    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Everton and Leeds United will meet at Hill Dickinson Stadium in a fixture that presents an intriguing tactical contest between two sides separated by six places in the Premier League standings. Both teams bring solid recent form into this matchup, setting the stage for a closely contested battle that could have significant implications mid-season.</p>\n<p>Looking at the last seven meetings between Everton and Leeds United, Everton hold a slight edge with three wins, two draws and two defeats. These encounters have often produced tightly balanced affairs, with neither side consistently dominating the other in recent seasons. This trend hints that a draw or a narrow win for either team would align with past results.</p>\n<p>Everton have become hard to beat in recent weeks, remaining undefeated in three straight matches. Over the last six games, they have won twice, drawn three, and suffered just a single defeat, averaging 1.17 goals scored and 1 conceded per match. When at home, however, Everton have struggled to press home their advantage, going winless in 83% of their last six at their own ground, with two draws and a loss. Their attack has not fired on all cylinders at Hill Dickinson Stadium, averaging 1.33 goals scored and conceding 2.</p>\n<p>Leeds United mirror Everton's recent upward trend with just one loss in their past six matches as well. They too have two wins and three draws, but slightly outscore Everton with an average of 1.5 goals per match and only 1.17 conceded. This suggests they may carry a touch more attacking threat away from home, and they also register more shots on goal per match on average (5.5 versus Everton’s 3.83).</p>\n<p>Everton currently sit 10th with 9 wins, 5 draws and 8 defeats from 22 league matches, with a slight negative goal difference of -1. Goals have not been easy to come by, scoring an average of 1.09 per game and conceding 1.14.</p>\n<p>Leeds United find themselves at 16th, but have played to more draws (7) and wins (6) than losses (9). Their positive attacking intent is clear, with 30 goals scored in 22 games, though a leaky defense has let in 37, for an average of 1.68 conceded per outing and a -7 difference.</p>\n<p>Everton have demonstrated resilience by avoiding defeat in 83% of their last six fixtures in all competitions. However, their home form is less convincing, marked by a run of draws and only a 40% clean sheet rate in their last 15 at Hill Dickinson Stadium.</p>\n<p>Leeds are also tough to beat, undefeated in 82% of their last 11 matches in all competitions. A significant note is their inability to turn stalemates into victories, recording draws in half of their last 10, while going winless in 11 of their previous 13 away games in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jordan Pickford</p>\n<p>Defenders: Nathan Patterson, James Tarkowski, Jake O'Brien, Vitaliy Mykolenko</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Dwight McNeil, Jack Grealish, Merlin Röhl, James Garner, Harrison Armstrong</p>\n<p>Attackers: Thierno Barry</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Lucas Perri</p>\n<p>Defenders: Pascal Struijk, Joe Rodon, Jaka Bijol</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Gabriel Gudmundsson, Ethan Ampadu, Brenden Aaronson, Anton Stach, James Justin, Ilia Gruev</p>\n<p>Attackers: Noah Okafor</p>\n<p>This match is likely to be tightly contested, with both sides capable of creating chances but also being equally robust defensively. With several recent matches between these sides ending without a decisive victor and given the current trends, the most probable outcome forecast is a draw, with about 41% probability and a possible 2-2 scoreline. The data suggests goals could be shared, but neither side looks dominant enough to claim all three points convincingly, making shared spoils a realistic prospect.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Carrow Road braces for an intriguing Championship contest as Norwich City host leaders Coventry City on January 26, 2026. With both clubs searching for crucial points at different ends of the standings, recent form and tactical choices could shape the outcome.</p>\n<p>As the regular season enters a decisive phase, Norwich City take on Coventry City in a matchup that has profound implications for both ends of the table. Philippe Clement’s side is striving to break free from the lower rungs, while Frank Lampard’s visitors look to consolidate their commanding position at the summit.</p>\n<p>Norwich come into this game sitting 20th, with 8 wins, 6 draws, and 14 losses from 28 Championship matches. Their goal difference reads minus 5, as they have scored 35 and conceded 40 so far. Coventry, meanwhile, lead the standings after 28 games, boasting 17 victories, 7 draws, and only 4 losses, with a formidable 61 goals scored and 31 allowed, giving them a healthy +30 goal differential.</p>\n<p>The last meeting between these sides, played on September 13, 2025, finished 1-1. Coventry dominated proceedings at home with 28 shots (4 on target) and held 64% of possession, while Norwich could muster just 4 shots (one on goal) with 36% of the ball. Mathias Kvistgaarden put Norwich ahead on 17 minutes, but after relentless pressure, Haji Wright rescued a point for Coventry deep into stoppage time. Dangerous attacks favored Coventry by 84 to 31, underlining their forward drive, but Norwich’s resilience kept them in the contest.</p>\n<p>Turning to recent form, Norwich bring momentum from 3 consecutive wins across all competitions and are undefeated in their last 3, hinting at a resurgence. Over their last 6 matches, they have won 4 and lost 2, averaging 2.33 goals scored and 1 conceded per game. However, their home form is a concern, with just 1 win and 2 losses in their last 3 at Carrow Road, conceding 1.33 goals on average and scoring 1.67.</p>\n<p>On the visitors’ side, Coventry’s last 6 matches show mixed results: 2 wins, 1 draw, and 3 losses, scoring 1.17 and conceding 1.5 per outing. Away from home, they have drawn and lost 3 each in their last 6, failing to win any of their last 6 away games but remaining undefeated in 16 of their last 20 league matches.</p>\n<p>Main trends suggest Norwich have found form, winning 7 of their last 12 across all competitions and going undefeated in 8 of their past 10, yet they have lost half of their last 28 league games. Coventry’s consistency stands out, with 55% wins in their last 40 fixtures and 65% wins in their previous 20 league games. However, they have hit a winless patch away, not securing victory in 6 of their last 7 away matches.</p>\n<p>Squad selection will play a role. Norwich are without Ante Crnac, Amankwah Forson, and Mirko Topić due to injuries, putting pressure on their midfield depth. Coventry miss only Oliver Dovin, backup goalkeeper.</p>\n<p><strong>Norwich City Probable Lineup:</strong><br/> Goalkeeper: Vladan Kovačević<br/> Defenders: Harry Darling, Ruairi McConville, Kellen Fisher, Ben Chrisene<br/> Midfielders: Kenny McLean, P. Mattsson, Matej Jurasek, Ali Ahmed, Jacob Wright<br/> Attackers: Jovon Makama</p>\n<p><strong>Coventry City Probable Lineup:</strong><br/> Goalkeeper: Carl Rushworth<br/> Defenders: Jay Dasilva, Liam Kitching, Joel Latibeaudiere, Milan van Ewijk<br/> Midfielders: Jack Rudoni, Matt Grimes, Romain Esse, Josh Eccles, Ephron Mason-Clark<br/> Attackers: Haji Wright</p>\n<p>Clement has rotated his midfield with injuries, but McLean, Mattsson, and Jurasek have been constants, suggesting they will anchor once again. Lampard’s configuration typically involves Grimes and Rudoni centrally with support from attacking fullbacks.</p>\n<p>Coventry hold the statistical upper hand: they are unbeaten in 16 of their last 20 league matches and have scored an average of 2.18 goals this season, compared to Norwich's 1.25. Norwich’s defense, having conceded 40, will face a stern test against Wright and Mason-Clark’s movement.</p>\n<p>With a predicted probability of 49% for a Coventry victory and a likely 1-2 scoreline, all data points toward a competitive contest shaped by Coventry’s attacking threat and Norwich’s improved recent performances. Expect goals, with over 2.5 a strong possibility given both teams’ statistical trends and tactical openness.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Girona welcome Getafe to the Estadi Municipal de Montilivi on the 26th of January 2026, with both sides looking to improve their positions in the La Liga standings. Girona appear in better shape based on recent home encounters and will hope to capitalize on Getafe’s ongoing difficulties away from home.</p>\n<p>When Girona host Getafe, the statistics lean in favor of the Catalans: over the last six meetings at Montilivi, Girona have claimed four victories, drawn once, and dropped only a single contest. Within the last five home games against Getafe, Girona have taken three wins, and in two of those, victory came by at least a two-goal margin. This historic advantage should add confidence to Míchel’s side as they look to extend their positive run.</p>\n<p>Girona’s recent performances in all competitions show a moderately strong run, with four wins and two losses in their past six matches. They have averaged 1.17 goals per outing, while conceding 1.33, suggesting a balanced side capable of both scoring and being broken down defensively. At home in their last three matches, however, the scoring rate drops to just 0.67 per game, with one win, one draw, and one defeat, exposing some inconsistency in front of their own supporters.</p>\n<p>On the opposite end, Getafe’s recent form is a significant concern. Without a win in their last six games and just a lone draw to show for their efforts, the Madrid side have scored merely 0.5 goals per game while conceding twice that amount. Their away form remains especially poor, with no wins in their last 11 on the road and a 53% loss rate in the last 15 away fixtures.</p>\n<p>Girona sit 9th in La Liga after 20 games, with six wins, six draws, and eight defeats. Their negative 14-goal difference is reflective of some defensive lapses across the campaign, but their ability to score at home and in key fixtures keeps them in the mid-table mix. The team has managed 20 goals and leaked 34, underlining both their threat and their vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Getafe find themselves in 15th place, mirroring Girona’s win count but losing three more times and drawing three less. Their attack has labored thanks to a league-low 0.75 goals per game, while conceding 1.3 per match. Their goal difference stands at minus 11, and survival is becoming an increasingly pressing topic as their unproductive spell continues.</p>\n<p>Girona have won 50% of their last 10 league games and, crucially, have not tasted defeat in six of their last seven home matches. Clean sheets have also been frequent, with three in their previous seven at the Montilivi. Getafe, by contrast, are winless in 8 of their last 10 league outings and have gone winless in 83% of their last 12 in all competitions. They’ve struggled to contain opponents, losing 67% in their last dozen fixtures while facing a mounting loss trend away and at home alike.</p>\n<p>Given the available personnel and the most-used formations in their recent games, the expected lineups factor in sidelined absentees and recent patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Girona</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Paulo Gazzaniga</p>\n<p>Defenders: Hugo Rincón, Vitor Reis, Daley Blind, Álex Moreno</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Arnau Martínez, Thomas Lemar, Viktor Tsygankov, Bryan Gil, Iván Martín</p>\n<p>Attackers: Vladyslav Vanat</p>\n<p><strong>Getafe</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: David Soria</p>\n<p>Defenders: Dakonam Djené, Juan Iglesias, Domingos Duarte, Diego Rico</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Luis Milla, Javi Muñoz, Adrián Liso, Kiko Femenía, Mario Martín</p>\n<p>Attackers: Martín Satriano</p>\n<p>Girona will be without Portu, Juan Carlos, Azzedine Ounahi, and Donny van de Beek. For Getafe, Davinchi, Mauro Arambarri, Borja Mayoral, Allan Nyom, and Abdel Abqar are absent.</p>\n<p>Taking into account Girona’s historical dominance over Getafe at Montilivi and the away side’s lingering struggles, the Forebet algorithm places the home team as favorites with a 47% probability for a Girona win and a 2-1 predicted scoreline. Getafe’s ongoing winless run and declining defense further skews expectations in favor of the hosts, who have proven their mettle against Getafe in the past and are likely to exploit those weaknesses.</p>\n<p>In summary, Girona’s combination of historical home strength and Getafe’s protracted tactical and confidence issues point to a scenario where Míchel’s side can edge another victory and sustain their firm grip on the La Liga mid-table.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi is set for another crucial Serie A clash, as out-of-form Verona face a motivated Udinese side looking to climb the league table. Both teams come in with contrasting ambitions and recent fortunes, making for a testing encounter in the Italian top flight.</p>\n<p>Neither side has been setting the league alight, but the circumstances for Verona are especially challenging. In their last six matches in all competitions, Verona have struggled, recording zero wins, two draws, and four losses. Their attack is faltering with just 0.67 goals per game, while conceding an average of two goals per contest. The home advantage has brought no respite; Verona have lost their last three at Bentegodi, conceding 2.33 on average and not finding a single win.</p>\n<p>Udinese, on the other hand, have found marginally better form. Their last six outings include one win, two draws, and three defeats, with an average of one goal scored and 1.83 conceded per game. The away performances reveal a vulnerability too, with only one win in their most recent three on the road and an average of 2.33 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>Direct clashes between these sides have been far from one-sided. Their last three Serie A meetings have seen Verona win once and draws on two occasions, with Udinese yet to taste victory in that period. Both teams have put in disciplined defensive performances in these encounters, and Verona have avoided defeat against Udinese in their last three head-to-head matches.</p>\n<p>The Serie A table paints a bleak picture for Verona. With just two wins in 21 matches, paired with eight draws and 11 losses, they sit bottom in 20th position. Their 17 goals scored mark one of the lowest tallies in the division, and their defense has not fared better, letting in 34 for a goal difference of minus 17.</p>\n<p>Udinese’s position is more comfortable but far from exemplary. They sit in 10th place, thanks to seven wins and five draws, balanced against nine losses. Their attack is slightly more productive than Verona’s, with 22 goals, but their defense has conceded nearly as many as the hosts, with 33 allowed and a goal difference of minus 11.</p>\n<p>Verona’s enduring struggle is clear looking at key trends. They have failed to win in 34 of their last 40 matches across all competitions, a staggering drought. This year, their home form has continued in a similar vein, with 90% of their last 20 home matches ending without victory. Draws have been a recurring result in half of their last 16 home outings.</p>\n<p>Udinese’s away results are also mixed. They have dropped 11 of their last 20 away matches in all competitions, and in the league, they have failed to win five of their last six. Losing by two or more goals has happened in 36% of their previous 25 away matches, indicating a potential weakness Verona might target.</p>\n<p><strong>Verona</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Lorenzo Montipò</p>\n<p>Defenders: Victor Nelsson, Tobias Slotsager, Unai Núñez</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Cheikh Niasse, Domagoj Bradarić, Suat Serdar, Antoine Bernede, Roberto Gagliardini</p>\n<p>Attackers: Gift Orban, Amin Sarr</p>\n<p>With Martin Frese, Rafik Belghali, Tomas Suslov, Armel Bella-Kotchap, Fallou Cham, and Moatasem Al-Musrati sidelined through injury, Verona will likely deploy a 3-5-2 system. Elimination of frequent absentees and use of the most consistent recent starters points towards stability despite missing several core options.</p>\n<p><strong>Udinese</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Maduka Okoye</p>\n<p>Defenders: Christian Kabasele, Oumar Solet, Thomas Kristensen, Hassane Kamara</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Alessandro Zanoli, Jesper Karlström, Lennon Miller, Jurgen Ekkelenkamp</p>\n<p>Attackers: Keinan Davis, Arthur Atta</p>\n<p>Without Nicolò Zaniolo due to injury, Udinese will probably revert to their more recent 4-4-2 framework, keeping Lennon Miller in the engine room and giving Keinan Davis and Arthur Atta responsibility in attack.</p>\n<p>Form, history, and personnel constraints all offer a slight advantage to Udinese. The visitors have shown enough quality on their travels to suggest they can claim all three points if they maintain defensive discipline. Verona’s inability to convert performances into wins, underscored by a 90% winless home rate over their last 20 at Bentegodi, could prove costly once more. The most probable outcome is a narrow Udinese victory, reflected in algorithmic estimates at 39% for an away win, possibly with a clean sheet if defensive standards are met. The hosts must find their scoring touch to disrupt this prediction, but recent data gives Udinese the edge in this matchup.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Porto have been relentless on their march through the Liga Portugal regular season, and their next test arrives at the Estádio do Dragão against a Gil Vicente side that has proven to be a tough nut to crack. With both teams carrying unbeaten streaks, the stage is set for an intriguing tactical battle.</p>\n<p>The last time these two sides squared off, Porto emerged with a convincing 2-0 away victory at Gil Vicente. That match, played just five months ago, saw Porto put together a controlled display with 59% ball possession and a slight edge in total shots (15 to 14). Notably, Porto doubled Gil Vicente's shots on target (4 to 2), reflecting their clinical approach.</p>\n<p>The breakthrough came early, with Victor Froholdt netting in the 20th minute, followed by a second from Pepê just after halftime in the 47th minute. Despite Gil Vicente’s 41 dangerous attacks to Porto’s 46, Porto’s defense rarely looked troubled, exemplifying their organizational solidity that continues to be a hallmark this season.</p>\n<p>Porto step into the fixture in peak condition, having captured all six of their last six matches, conceding an incredible average of just 0.17 goals per game and scoring two per match. Their dominance at home is equally impressive, with three consecutive wins at the Dragão, averaging 2.33 goals scored and conceding only 0.33 per game.</p>\n<p>Gil Vicente, meanwhile, have kept their own unbeaten run intact over their past six matches. However, these have been drawn out battles, with five draws and only one win, and a rather modest attacking output of 1.33 goals scored per match.</p>\n<p>In the league standings, Porto sit firmly in first, boasting 17 wins and a single draw from 18 matches, with a league-high +33 goal difference. Their average of 2.06 goals per match, coupled with a league-best defensive record (just 0.22 goals conceded per game), is a testament to their consistency and balance.</p>\n<p>Gil Vicente are fourth, with eight wins, seven draws, and three defeats from the same number of games. Their goal difference of +11 and defensive record of conceding 0.72 per match indicate a sturdy side, though their average of just 1.33 goals for points toward challenges in the final third.</p>\n<p>Porto’s form in all competitions is outstanding, with victory in 78% of their last 40 matches and undefeated in 14 of their last 15. Wins by two or more goals have come in 38% of those games, and clean sheets in over half of their last 40 home fixtures.</p>\n<p>Gil Vicente’s resilience shows in their record as well. They are undefeated in 17 of their last 21 and have kept clean sheets in 42% of their previous 12 away matches. However, a winless streak of seven in their last eight league games and six of their last seven away contests highlights their struggle to turn draws into wins.</p>\n<p>Porto (4-3-3)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Diogo Costa</p>\n<p>Defenders: Jakub Kiwior, Jan Bednarek, Martim Fernandes, Francisco Moura</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Victor Froholdt, Pablo Rosario, Rodrigo Mora</p>\n<p>Attackers: William Gomes, Samu Aghehowa, Pepê</p>\n<p>Gil Vicente (4-2-3-1)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Andrew da Silva Ventura</p>\n<p>Defenders: José Carlos Teixeira Lopes dos Reis Gonçalves, Marvin Adolphe Fabrice Elimbi Gilbert, Antonio Espigares Morillas, Hevertton Ciriaco Santos</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Luís André Leite Esteves, Facundo Agustín Cáseres</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Tidjany Chabrol Touré, Santiago García González, Murilo de Souza Costa</p>\n<p>Attacker: Pablo Felipe Pereira de Jesus</p>\n<p>Porto’s momentum, highlighted by their nine match winning and unbeaten streaks, sets them apart, but Gil Vicente’s draw-heavy recent pattern underscores their defensive organization. Porto are expected to control possession and press early, but Gil Vicente’s compactness on the road could lead to a closely contested result.</p>\n<p>The prediction leans toward a draw, carrying a 46% probability with a forecast scoreline of 2-2. Porto’s attack will test Gil Vicente, yet the visitors have shown an ability to disrupt the rhythm of superior teams and grind out results.</p>\n<p>With Porto’s perfect record at home and Gil Vicente’s knack for stubbornly clinging to points, this clash could come down to moments of efficiency in front of goal. Gil Vicente’s record of being winless in six of their last seven away games means they will need to find extra quality to break their cycle. Porto, meanwhile, aim to preserve their unbeaten status and extend their lead atop the league.</p>",
