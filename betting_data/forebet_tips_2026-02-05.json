    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Quarter final football often swings on details, and this one sets a poised contrast. Real Betis arrive with a lively home rhythm, while Atlético Madrid travel with that familiar edge in control and economy. The balance of craft and structure could define who moves on.</p>\n<p>Head to head at the Benito Villamarín has tilted toward Atlético. Across the last 10 meetings in Seville, Betis have 2 wins, 3 draws and 5 losses. The margins have usually been narrow, but Atlético’s knack for squeezing control out of tense nights has often told.</p>\n<p>Form at home gives Betis a platform. Over the last three home matches in all competitions they have three wins, averaging 2 goals scored and only 0.67 conceded, with 58.33% possession and 4.33 shots on target from 15 attempts per match. That blend of volume and efficiency underlines a team comfortable dictating the ball and territory.</p>\n<p>Zooming out to the last six in all competitions, Betis are 4 wins, 0 draws and 2 losses, scoring 1.5 and conceding 1.17 per match with 15.67 shots and 3.67 on target, plus 54.17% possession. It suggests a side willing to take initiative, though the defensive figures hint that clean sheets may still need work against higher calibre opponents.</p>\n<p>Atlético’s broader picture features control and restraint. In the last six across all competitions they are 3 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss. The headline is at the back, where they concede just 0.5 per match. They pair that with 17.67 shots and 6.17 on target, alongside 57% possession, a sign their chance creation has been steady even while keeping games tight.</p>\n<p>On the road, Simeone’s team have been hard to shift. They are undefeated in 9 of their last 11 away matches in all competitions, with 5 clean sheets across their last 12 away, and a 50% away win rate in that same 12 match window. Three draws in the last six away also show why stalemates are always in play when Atlético manage the tempo.</p>\n<p>Cup specific trends push and pull in different directions. Betis have won 75% of their last 12 Copa del Rey matches, scoring 3.42 and conceding 1.17 on that run, and they are undefeated in 35 of their last 39 in this competition. Yet at home in the cup they are undefeated in 11 of their last 12, but winless in 8 of their last 10, which underlines how frequently these ties in Seville have been decided by fine margins and draws.</p>\n<p>Atlético’s cup record is robust. They have won 65% of their last 20 Copa del Rey matches and are undefeated in 23 of their last 28 in the competition. Notably, they have won by 2 or more goals in 44% of their last 34 Copa del Rey matches, a signal that when they get the first goal, they often control the rest.</p>\n<p>Tactically, Betis should lean on a 4-2-3-1 that encourages width and quick combinations between the lines. Antony and Abde bring direct running, while Marc Roca’s distribution from deep sets the rhythm. Atlético will likely mirror their familiar 4-4-2, compact between the units, with swift vertical releases toward Julián Álvarez and Alexander Sørloth to test Betis on transitions.</p>\n<p>Key battlegrounds will center on midfield control. Roca and Sergi Altimira handling the press of Koke and Pablo Barrios could dictate who plays higher. Atlético’s front pair against the aerial presence of Marc Bartra and the mobility of Natan is another hinge, especially with Betis averaging 15 shots recently but meeting an opponent that allows very little inside the box and has 5 away clean sheets across the last 12.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Betis probable XI, 4-2-3-1</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Pau López</p>\n<p>Defenders: Ángel Ortiz, Natan, Marc Bartra, Diego Llorente</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Marc Roca, Sergi Altimira, Antony, Pablo Fornals, Abde Ezzalzouli</p>\n<p>Attackers: Cédric Bakambu</p>\n<p><em>Sidelined Betis</em>: Rodrigo Riquelme, Isco, Sofyan Amrabat, Cucho Hernández, Ricardo Rodríguez</p>\n<p><strong>Atlético Madrid probable XI, 4-4-2</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jan Oblak</p>\n<p>Defenders: Marc Pubill, José María Giménez, Dávid Hancko, Matteo Ruggeri</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Marcos Llorente, Koke, Pablo Barrios, Álex Baena</p>\n<p>Attackers: Julián Álvarez, Alexander Sørloth</p>\n<p><em>Sidelined Atlético</em>: Antoine Griezmann, Clément Lenglet</p>\n<p>With Betis strong at home and Atlético sturdy away, the numbers lean toward a tight contest. Atlético are undefeated in 9 of their last 11 away, while Betis are undefeated in 11 of their last 12 home Copa del Rey matches but winless in 8 of their last 10 at home in this competition. The projection shades toward a stalemate. Prediction: Draw at 40% probability with a score lean of 2-2.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two of Serie A’s most consistent teams, Atalanta and Juventus, are set for another compelling contest at the Gewiss Stadium in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals on February 5, 2026. With both sides boasting solid recent form and strong histories in the competition, this encounter promises to test their tactical prowess.</p>\n<p>There is little to separate Atalanta and Juventus in their most recent head-to-head meetings. Out of the last three encounters, Atalanta have secured one victory while the other two fixtures were drawn, giving the side from Bergamo a psychological boost going into this match. Notably, Atalanta have not lost to Juventus in these last three games, underscoring a period of resilience against one of Italy’s most decorated clubs.</p>\n<p>Both teams are accustomed to facing each other on big stages, and over the last eight matches at the Gewiss Stadium between the two, Atalanta have suffered defeat four times. However, their recent head-to-head record suggests a more even balance of power.</p>\n<p>Atalanta have registered mixed results in their last six matches, recording two wins, two draws and two losses. They have averaged 1.5 goals scored and conceded 0.83 per match, reflecting a team that is relatively solid at the back, yet at times has struggled to find goals consistently.</p>\n<p>At home, Atalanta’s results have been more impressive, with two wins in their last three games. They have scored an average of 2.67 goals and conceded one, while generating 17.67 shots per game and maintaining nearly 59% possession, indicating their ability to control proceedings at the Gewiss Stadium.</p>\n<p>Juventus, meanwhile, are in strong form, winning four of their last six and losing just once. Their attack has been sharper, averaging 2.33 goals per game, with defensive solidity highlighted by just 0.33 goals conceded per match. In terms of recent away performances, they have displayed balance, but their possession stats tend to slightly drop on the road.</p>\n<p>Atalanta have displayed resilience at home, remaining undefeated in 80% of their last 20 home matches in all competitions. Their record of seven clean sheets in the last 17 home encounters and an average of 1.65 goals scored per game at home highlight their strength as hosts.</p>\n<p>In the Coppa Italia specifically, Atalanta have a 67% home win record across their last 12 fixtures, scoring an impressive 2.75 goals on average per match. However, against Juventus, their fortunes have been mixed, losing four times in the last eight home meetings with the Bianconeri.</p>\n<p>Juventus, on the other hand, have not been defeated in 18 of their last 20 Coppa Italia matches. In all competitions, they have sustained this momentum, with an unbeaten run in 83% of their last 40 matches. Their defensive work is especially notable away from home, achieving four clean sheets in their last 10 away matches and conceding just 0.8 goals per game over that span.</p>\n<p>With injuries to Kamaldeen Sulemana for Atalanta and Dušan Vlahović for Juventus, both coaches will make tactical adjustments but have the squads to cover those absences.</p>\n<p>Atalanta</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Marco Carnesecchi</p>\n<p>Defenders: Honest Ahanor, Berat Djimsiti, Giorgio Scalvini</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Davide Zappacosta, Éderson, Marten de Roon, Nicola Zalewski</p>\n<p>Attackers: Charles De Ketelaere, Giacomo Raspadori, Gianluca Scamacca</p>\n<p>Juventus</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Michele Di Gregorio</p>\n<p>Defenders: Bremer, Lloyd Kelly, Pierre Kalulu, Andrea Cambiaso</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Manuel Locatelli, Khéphren Thuram, Weston McKennie, Francisco Conceição</p>\n<p>Attackers: Kenan Yıldız, Jonathan David</p>\n<p>With both teams performing at a high level and rarely suffering defeats, margins are expected to be slim. Juventus carry strong momentum, being undefeated in 18 of their last 20 Coppa Italia matches and winning 11 of their last 15 in all competitions. Atalanta have not lost to Juventus in their past three meetings and are robust at home, but Juventus’ current balance in attack and defense gives them a slight predicted edge, with the probability algorithm favoring a Bianconeri win at 39%.</p>\n<p>All signs indicate a tactically sharp contest at Gewiss Stadium, where one moment could be decisive for a place in the Coppa Italia semifinals.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Knockout football rewards clarity, and both Strasbourg and Monaco arrive with very different ways of finding it. One builds in bursts, the other leans on structure. Their collision promises a tight, calculating tie decided by small details.</p>\n<p>Recent history at the Stade de la Meinau tilts only slightly toward the visitors. Across Strasbourg’s last eight home meetings with Monaco, the ledger reads 3 wins, 1 draw and 4 losses, a narrow edge that hints at how finely poised this matchup tends to be.</p>\n<p>Strasbourg’s current form carries substance. Over their last six matches in all competitions they have 4 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss, averaging 2.67 goals scored and 1 conceded. At home across the last three, they are 2 wins and 1 loss, with 1.67 scored and 1.33 conceded.</p>\n<p>The method is clear: Strasbourg take only 9 total shots per match in that six-game sample, but 5.17 of them hit the target, an accuracy that compensates for low average possession of 34.33%. They are comfortable without the ball and direct when they have it.</p>\n<p>Widen the lens and the profile holds. Strasbourg have 23 wins in their last 40 matches in all competitions, and they haven’t been defeated in 8 of their last 10. At home they have 55% wins across the last 40 and haven’t been defeated in 9 of their last 11, with 7 clean sheets in their last 17 here.</p>\n<p>In the Coupe de France, Strasbourg’s last 12 show 7 wins and they haven’t been defeated in 10 of those. Their last 6 home cup games bring 3 wins, with tighter margins at 1.33 scored and 1.33 conceded, and an even lower 27.67% possession, reinforcing a pragmatic approach.</p>\n<p>Monaco’s recent six-match run in all competitions is balanced at 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses, averaging 1.5 scored and 1.67 conceded. They produce 12.33 shots and 5 on target per match with 50.17% possession. They are also on a small uptick, undefeated in their last 3.</p>\n<p>There is a split in their travel and cup profiles. In all competitions they have lost 50% of their last 16 away matches and have been beaten by 2 or more goals in 3 of their last 7. Yet in the Coupe de France, they have 12 wins in the last 20 and haven’t been defeated in 18 of those, with 10 wins by 2+ goals and 5 draws in their last 10.</p>\n<p>These trends set up a stylistic duel: Strasbourg’s compact, low-possession game against Monaco’s higher-volume shooting and steadier share of the ball. The midfield axis is pivotal, where Monaco’s Lamine Camara and Denis Zakaria can dictate tempo, while Strasbourg rely on direct progression and a high on-target ratio to carve chances.</p>\n<p>Team news could matter at both ends. Strasbourg are without Valentín Barco, Maxi Oyedele and Emmanuel Emegha. Monaco’s list is longer, removing Wout Faes, Lukas Hradecky, Paul Pogba, Mohammed Salisu, Takumi Minamino, Christian Mawissa and Eric Dier from consideration.</p>\n<p>Strasbourg probable XI (4-2-3-1)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Mike Penders</p>\n<p>Defenders: Guela Doué, Ismaël Doukouré, Lucas Høgsberg, Ben Chilwell</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Samir El Mourabet, Rafael Luís, Martial Godo, Julio Enciso, Diego Moreira</p>\n<p>Attackers: Joaquín Panichelli</p>\n<p>Monaco probable XI (4-2-3-1)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Philipp Köhn</p>\n<p>Defenders: Vanderson, Thilo Kehrer, J. Teze, Caio Henrique</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Denis Zakaria, Lamine Camara, Maghnes Akliouche, Aleksandr Golovin, Krépin Diatta</p>\n<p>Attackers: Folarin Balogun</p>\n<p>With Strasbourg’s home resilience and Monaco’s robust cup record, the margins point toward parity. Monaco’s tendency to draw in the competition and Strasbourg’s disciplined structure support a stalemate. Prediction: Draw at 36%, with 0-0 a very live outcome.</p>",
