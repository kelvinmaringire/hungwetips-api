    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Manchester United and Manchester City are set for another tightly contested Manchester derby at Old Trafford, with both teams keen to assert their status in the Premier League. History, form, and recent meetings between the two sides point towards a complex tactical battle rather than an outright shootout.</p>\n<p>The previous clash between these two sides saw Manchester City establish firm control with a convincing 3-0 win on home soil. Despite Manchester United's higher possession rate of 55%, City displayed ruthless efficiency. Phil Foden opened the scoreline in the 18th minute, with Erling Haaland adding a brace in the second half (53rd and 68th minutes). While United outnumbered City in overall shots (12 to 13), their efforts yielded only two on target compared to City's six, underlining the decisive quality up front for the defending champions.</p>\n<p>The dangerous attack count favored United by 64 to 34, but City proved far more clinical in both penalty areas. The previous encounter exemplified recent trends, as United have now failed to win in 18 of their last 20 matches against City, with 45% of those resulting in defeats by a margin of two or more goals.</p>\n<p>Turning to recent form, Manchester United's last six matches in all competitions have seen them claim just one victory, alongside four draws and a loss. They have averaged 1.67 goals scored and 1.67 conceded per match, indicating both competitive matches and defensive lapses. Draws have been a recurring theme, with seven from their last twelve outings, and they are currently undefeated in ten of those fixtures. However, an 83% winless rate in their last six matches underlines the struggles to claim all three points.</p>\n<p>At Old Trafford, United's recent home record offers a glimmer of encouragement. They have drawn two and won one of their last three, scoring an average of two goals per game. In their last eleven league matches at home, they have stayed undefeated in 82% of them, showing improved resilience in familiar surroundings.</p>\n<p>Manchester City, by contrast, maintain a more formidable run. Their last six matches yielded three wins and three draws, with no losses. A potent attack continues to deliver (1.5 goals per match), and a solid defense has allowed only 0.5 goals per game in this period. With 85% undefeated in their last forty matches across all competitions, City have also managed to win by two or more goals in 40% of their last ten fixtures. Their last twelve away matches have ended in ten without defeat.</p>\n<p>Recent meetings between the two clubs have not always been one-sided, with two draws in their last four head-to-heads. Nonetheless, City's superiority, especially in critical moments, remains a strong narrative thread in this rivalry.</p>\n<p>As for probable lineups, both teams look set to field largely familiar faces with no significant sidelined absences reported heading into the fixture.</p>\n<p><strong>Manchester United</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Senne Lammens</p>\n<p>Defenders: Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martínez, Ayden Heaven, Luke Shaw</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Matheus Cunha, Patrick Dorgu, Joshua Zirkzee</p>\n<p>Attackers: Benjamin Sesko</p>\n<p>The 4-2-3-1 formation has offered United a balance between defensive cover and attacking diversity, with the midfield expected to play a crucial role in disrupting City's rhythm and controlling transitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Manchester City</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Gianluigi Donnarumma</p>\n<p>Defenders: Abdukodir Khusanov, Nathan Aké, Matheus Nunes, Nico O'Reilly</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Rodri, Bernardo Silva, Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Tijjani Reijnders</p>\n<p>Attackers: Erling Haaland</p>\n<p>Guardiola's side have consistently lined up in a 4-1-4-1 formation, relying on Rodri's protection ahead of the defense and Foden and Silva's creativity to support Haaland's predatory instincts.</p>\n<p>From a statistical perspective, City’s defensive strength and proficiency away from home (43% clean sheets over the last thirty away games) stacks up well against United's struggle for wins. However, United's strong home record and City's run of three consecutive draws in their last three matches suggest there is little to separate them coming in.</p>\n<p>Prediction leans toward a draw as the most probable outcome, assessed at 39% likelihood, with a scoreline of 1-1 reflecting both sides’ tendencies in recent outings. Given United’s resilience at Old Trafford and City's formidable consistency, this looks set to be a contest defined by margins and moments rather than dominance.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">With Ipswich Town riding a wave of strong form and Blackburn Rovers searching for consistency, this Championship clash at Portman Road is set for a real test in both camps’ ambitions. Momentum, margin, and recent trends on both sides point to a revealing battle in Suffolk.</p>\n<p>The forthcoming meeting between Ipswich Town and Blackburn Rovers brings together two sides on contrasting trajectories in the Championship table. Ipswich, holding third position with 42 goals scored in 25 matches, have managed to assert themselves as one of the more efficient sides in the league, particularly at home.</p>\n<p>Blackburn, positioned 20th with 24 goals from the same number of fixtures, have encountered both struggles in attack and a defense that has not reliably shut out opponents, conceding 30 times. Their negative goal difference and inability to consistently pick up three points away from home will be an immediate hurdle here.</p>\n<p>The most recent encounter serves as a closely contested blueprint. Played on December 2, 2025, at Blackburn, the match ended 1-1. Both sides registered three shots on target, though Blackburn engineered slightly more with 11 total shots to Ipswich’s 7 and edged possession with 52%. Notably, Blackburn registered 37 dangerous attacks compared to Ipswich’s 28. Gudjohnsen gave Blackburn the lead in the 76th minute, only for S. W. Egeli to equalize at the death for Ipswich in the 90th. The stalemate emphasized both sides’ resilience and underlined just how tight their matchups can be.</p>\n<p>Ipswich’s recent form, particularly at Portman Road, underscores their credentials. Across the last six matches, Ipswich have tasted victory four times, drawn once, and suffered only one loss, averaging 1.5 goals per game while conceding just 0.83. Their home form is even stronger: three wins from their last three at Portman Road, with two goals scored per match and under one conceded on average, speaks to both offensive potency and defensive structure.</p>\n<p>Key trends bolster Ipswich’s standing. Across their last 20 matches in all competitions, 11 wins have come alongside impressive statistical averages for shots on target and possession. Notably, they haven’t been defeated in 13 of their last 15 matches and have secured a win by a margin of two or more in 39% of their last 18 matches. At home, clean sheets in 5 of 12 outings reinforce their defensive credentials.</p>\n<p>Blackburn, meanwhile, have found it difficult to build momentum. Winless in 83% of their last 12 matches and having failed to claim victory in four straight, they’ll need to find something extra to break the cycle. Draws have characterized their campaign—six in the last 12 matches—with goals hard to come by, averaging less than one per game recently and only 0.33 goals in their last three outings away.</p>\n<p>Yet, there are minor positives for Blackburn: six clean sheets in their last 12 away matches, and they remain undefeated in six of their last seven away fixtures. These streaks show resilience but lack the cutting edge needed to consistently turn draws into wins.</p>\n<p>Looking at previous head-to-head encounters, Ipswich hold a slight edge, having won two of the last four meetings with Blackburn. This, combined with their surging run of form, tilts the balance in their favor.</p>\n<p>For projected lineups, Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna is likely to deploy his preferred 4-2-3-1. Based on the last three matches and considering player selections:</p>\n<p><b>Ipswich Town Probable Lineup:</b></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Christian Walton<br/>Defenders: Darnell Furlong, Dara O'Shea, Cédric Kipré, Leif Davis<br/>Midfielders: Azor Matusiwa, Jens Cajuste, Marcelino Núñez, Jaden Philogene, Kasey McAteer<br/>Attackers: Iván Azón</p>\n<p>Valérien Ismaël is set to stick with Blackburn’s 3-4-1-2, a formation that combines defensive stability with flexibility in midfield roles:</p>\n<p><b>Blackburn Rovers Probable Lineup:</b></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Aynsley Pears<br/>Defenders: George Pratt, Sean McLoughlin, Lewis Miller<br/>Midfielders: Sondre Tronstad, Ryan Hedges, Matthew Litherland, Moussa Baradji<br/>Attackers: Todd Cantwell, Axel Henriksson, Yuki Ohashi</p>\n<p>The prediction algorithm points towards an Ipswich Town victory, with a 46% probability of success. Ipswich’s sharper attack and defensive steel at home, backed by current momentum, make them favorites to secure all three points. Blackburn’s recent away resilience might keep things tight, but the hosts are primed to edge it.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">With the La Liga race intensifying, Real Madrid prepare to welcome Levante at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu on 17 January 2026. With a new manager, Real Madrid look to sustain their title ambitions while an under-pressure Levante seeks a pivotal result in their relegation fight. Both teams arrive with different momentum and aspirations, promising an intriguing contest in Spain’s capital.</p>\n<p>Previous encounters between these two sides at the Bernabéu reveal a balanced narrative. Across their last five meetings in Madrid, Real have claimed two wins, Levante have also managed to register two victories, and one clash ended in a draw. While Real Madrid's historic dominance in La Liga is well known, Levante’s ability to make life uncomfortable in Madrid is evident in that record.</p>\n<p>In the last six home encounters with Levante, Real have emerged victorious three times. It's a reminder that while the Madrid giants are favorites on paper, Levante’s resilience cannot be overlooked in these matchups.</p>\n<p>Real Madrid enter this clash in formidable form. Over their past six matches in all competitions, they have secured five wins and suffered a single defeat, averaging 2.67 goals scored and just 1.33 conceded per game. At home, that form is nearly as robust, with two victories and one loss in their last three Bernabéu outings, again averaging 2.67 goals per match.</p>\n<p>The Madridistas maintain aggressive offensive metrics, averaging nearly 16 shots per match across their recent form, while their possession typically borders just above 50%, highlighting a proactive but also vertical playing style under Alonso. Whether and how that keeps up under Arbeloa remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>Levante’s recent streaks hint at a more modest outlook. Over their last six games in all competitions, they have claimed two victories, two draws, and two defeats, while conceding less than a goal per match. However, a scoring rate of 1 goal per game underlines the challenge they face breaking down top-tier defenses like Real Madrid's.</p>\n<p>Levante's last 10 games have seen them winless in 80%, and in La Liga specifically, they have failed to claim three points in 83% of their last 18 fixtures—a run which highlights the severity of their current plight in the lower reaches of the table.</p>\n<p>Real Madrid are firmly ensconced in second place after 19 league games, stacking up 14 wins, 3 draws, and just 2 defeats. Their attacking firepower is a standout feature, with 41 goals scored (2.16 per game) and a goal difference of +24. Defensively, they remain tight with less than a goal conceded on average.</p>\n<p>Levante, meanwhile, occupy 19th in the league and are embroiled in a relegation battle. With only three wins from 18 games, they have a negative goal difference and a leaky backline, conceding 30 while only scoring 21. Every point is crucial for them as they attempt to claw away from the drop zone.</p>\n<p>Real Madrid’s unbeaten credentials shine across different sample sizes. They have not been defeated in 34 of their last 40 La Liga matches and are unbeaten in 13 of their previous 15 home games. Their attacking depth is matched by reliable defense, as evidenced by their 7 clean sheets in their most recent 17 home fixtures.</p>\n<p>Wins by a margin of 2 or more goals have occurred in 45% of their last 20 home La Liga matches. This bodes well for Madrid, especially when facing defensive struggles like Levante’s.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Levante have lost 50% of their last 20 matches across competitions and have failed to win in 80% of their last ten games. Their away record remains a concern, with four defeats from their past eight away outings, and they remain winless in 83% of their last 18 La Liga fixtures.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Madrid (likely 4-3-3)</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois</p>\n<p>Defenders: Raúl Asencio, Antonio Rüdiger, Dean Huijsen, Fran García</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Aurélien Tchouaméni, Jude Bellingham, Arda Güler</p>\n<p>Attackers: Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior, Kylian Mbappé</p>\n<p><strong>Levante (likely 4-2-3-1)</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Mathew Ryan</p>\n<p>Defenders: Jeremy Toljan, Adrián Dela, Matías Moreno, Diego Pampín</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Kervin Arriaga, Carlos Álvarez, Pablo Martínez, Iker Losada, Paco Cortés</p>\n<p>Attackers: Iván Romero</p>\n<p>The data presents a daunting scenario for Levante. Real Madrid's home form is clear: 87% win ratio in their last 15 home matches across all competitions, dominant shot and possession statistics, and an ability to control the game’s tempo at will.</p>\n<p>Levante, despite a recent undefeated run in their last three matches, have struggled for consistency and points in La Liga, remaining winless in 15 out of their last 18 league matches.</p>\n<p>With Kylian Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo leading the line, Real’s attacking options should be too much for Levante’s defense. The prediction algorithm supports this outlook, giving a 62% likelihood of a Real Madrid victory with the possibility of a convincing 4-0 scoreline.</p>",
