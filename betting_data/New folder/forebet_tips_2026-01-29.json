    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two teams with very different rhythms meet, one leaning on possession and continental home know‑how, the other built on an unbeaten platform and disciplined defending. The balance of strengths points toward a tight, tactical contest decided by small details in both boxes.</p>\n<p>Across the league stage, Viktoria Plzen have quietly set a sturdy benchmark. They sit higher in the section with 2 wins and 5 draws, still unbeaten after 7 matches, and conceding only 3 goals at 0.43 per game. FC Basel’s path has been more uneven at 2 wins and 5 losses with a 9 to 12 goal difference, yet their underlying metrics suggest they can force the issue at home.</p>\n<p>Basel’s last 6 matches in all competitions show a 2 wins, 3 draws and 1 loss return, averaging 1.5 scored and 1.5 conceded. They are generating 15.33 shots per match with 5.67 on target and holding 54.5% of the ball, which hints at a side capable of territory and tempo. Those numbers become even more pronounced at home across the last 3, where possession climbs to 60.33% and they still avoided defeat in each, drawing all three with tight 0.67 for and 0.67 against.</p>\n<p>The broader picture adds nuance. Basel haven’t been defeated in 8 of their last 10 in all competitions, yet they are winless in 6 of their last 7 home matches in all competitions. Contrast that with their Europa League home ledger, where they have won 71% of their last 17 and are undefeated in 10 of their last 12. On this stage, St. Jakob-Park has often been a platform for control and results.</p>\n<p>Plzen’s recent history is built on consistency. Over their last 6 in all competitions they have 2 wins, 3 draws and 1 loss, but the defensive outputs stand out: just 0.83 conceded per match, with 4.67 shots on target created from 12.33 total attempts. The macro trend backs it up: undefeated in 87% of their last 15 in all competitions and undefeated in 80% of their last 20 Europa League matches. It is a team that takes few risks, rarely gives gifts and thrives in one-score margins.</p>\n<p>Travel form supports that profile. Plzen are undefeated in 10 of their last 12 away matches in all competitions, with 43% clean sheets across the last 7 away. They do not monopolize the ball at 49% average possession in the last six, but they compress space well and keep games within reach.</p>\n<p>Tactically, the matchup reads as Basel’s structured possession against Plzen’s compact block and quick breaks. Xherdan Shaqiri’s ability to find pockets between lines is pivotal for Basel, while Philip Otele and Jeremy Agbonifo provide width that can stretch a back four. Albian Ajeti’s penalty-area movement offers a target for cutbacks and near-post deliveries.</p>\n<p>For Plzen, Tomas Ladra and Prince Adu carry threat in transition, and Rafiu Durosinmi’s runs across the line can isolate center backs. With Basel averaging more shots on target than Plzen in recent weeks, the home side may rack up volume, but converting against a unit that has allowed only 3 goals in 7 league-stage matches is the real test.</p>\n<p>Set pieces could swing it. Basel’s aerial presence through Flavius Daniliuc and the delivery of Shaqiri suit dead-ball scenarios, while Plzen’s organization on first and second contacts has underpinned their run of low concessions.</p>\n<p>Probable lineups:</p>\n<p>FC Basel (4-2-3-1)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Marwin Hitz</p>\n<p>Defenders: Kevin Rüegg, Flavius Daniliuc, Jonas Adjetey, Dominik Schmid</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Léo Leroy, Andrej Bacanin, Philip Otele, Xherdan Shaqiri, Jeremy Agbonifo</p>\n<p>Attackers: Albian Ajeti</p>\n<p>Viktoria Plzen (4-2-3-1)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Florian Wiegele</p>\n<p>Defenders: Amar Memic, Sampson Dweh, Vaclav Jemelka, Merchas Doski</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Lukas Cerv, Matej Valenta, Tomas Ladra, Denis Visinsky, Prince Adu</p>\n<p>Attackers: Matej Vydra</p>\n<p>Modeling the balance of strengths points toward a stalemate. The algorithmic projection gives the draw a 43% likelihood with 1-1 the most plausible scoreline, which aligns with Basel’s trio of recent home draws and Plzen’s habit of sharing points in the league stage.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Draw, 1-1. Basel’s possession and chance volume meet Plzen’s unbeaten resilience and defensive control, and the margins look too narrow for a decisive swing.</p>",
