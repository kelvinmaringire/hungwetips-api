    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two teams in fine fettle arrive from different angles of the Europa League table, and the matchup feels like a test of steel. PAOK have built a formidable groove at home, while Real Betis carry the sort of continental consistency that travels well. Small details, not sweeping narratives, look set to decide this one.</p>\n<p>On the league phase board, the contrast is clear. Real Betis sit 4th with 4 wins, 2 draws and no losses, scoring 11 and conceding just 4. PAOK are 18th with 2 wins, 3 draws and 1 defeat across six, yet their goal return is robust at 13, though offset by 10 against. That split hints at where each side has leaned in this campaign: Betis have kept things tight, PAOK have embraced risk and reward.</p>\n<p>Form in all competitions paints PAOK as one of Europe’s in-form sides. Over their last 6 matches they have 5 wins and 1 draw, averaging 2.5 goals scored and just 0.33 conceded, with 16.67 total shots, 7.67 on target and 58.17% possession. That mix of control and punch has been even more reliable at home in the same sample of 3 outings, where they are 2 wins and 1 draw, at 17.33 shots, 8 on target and 57.33% possession.</p>\n<p>Stretch the lens and the home edge hardens. PAOK haven’t been defeated in their last 20 home matches in all competitions, and they have won 75% of their last 12 at Toumba in all competitions. In Europa League terms, they are unbeaten in 10 of their last 12 home matches and have drawn 50% of their last 6 at home in this competition, a sign of close, controlled contests.</p>\n<p>Betis, though, travel with authority. In all competitions they have won 8 of their last 12 and have been undefeated in 87% of their last 30. Away from home, they are unbeaten in 92% of their last 12 and have won 50% of those, with 40% of their last 15 away victories coming by 2 or more goals. In the Europa League they have been unbeaten in 9 of their last 11, and 40% of their last 10 wins in the competition have been by 2 or more.</p>\n<p>Defensive benchmarks suggest a narrow margin. PAOK’s recent all-competitions baseline of 0.33 conceded per match meets a Betis Europa League average against of just 0.67 per game. At the other end, PAOK’s 2.5 per match over the last 6 is aggressive, while Betis bring a steady 1.83 per Europa League outing.</p>\n<p>Possession and shot profiles add texture. PAOK’s 16.67 shots and 7.67 on target per match across their last 6 underline sustained territory with end product. Betis are slightly lower at 15.17 shots and 5.5 on target, paired with 50.67% possession, but their efficiency and structure often outweigh raw volume.</p>\n<p>Selection factors matter. PAOK list Luka Gugeshashvili, Jiri Pavlenka and Dimitrios Monastirlis as unavailable among goalkeepers, with Giannis Konstantelias, Christos Zafeiris, Luka Ivanušec and Kiril Despodov also out. For Betis, Isco, Cédric Bakambu, Cucho Hernández and Ricardo Rodríguez are sidelined, which pushes creative and striking duties toward Giovani Lo Celso and Chimy Ávila.</p>\n<p>PAOK probable XI (4-2-3-1)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Antonis Tsiftsis</p>\n<p>Defenders: Jonjoe Kenny, Alessandro Vogliacco, Giannis Michailidis, Abdul Rahman Baba</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Soualiho Meïté, Magomed Ozdoev, Andrija Zivkovic, Taison, Dimitrios Pelkas</p>\n<p>Attackers: Georgios Giakoumakis</p>\n<p>Real Betis probable XI (4-2-3-1)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Álvaro Valles</p>\n<p>Defenders: Aitor Ruibal, Marc Bartra, Valentín Gómez, Junior Firpo</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Sergi Altimira, Marc Roca, Antony, Giovani Lo Celso, Pablo Fornals</p>\n<p>Attackers: Chimy Ávila</p>\n<p>Recent Europa League history tilts toward Betis, unbeaten in 9 of their last 11, while PAOK have avoided defeat in 8 of their last 10 in the competition and drawn 50% of their last 6 home matches in it. With PAOK’s home run and Betis’ defensive discipline, the margins feel thin and late moments could swing it.</p>\n<p>Probability view and pick: the algorithm leans Real Betis at 36% for the final outcome, and a 0-1 away win aligns with their league-phase consistency and PAOK’s tendency for tight Europa League home games. Prediction: Real Betis to edge it 0-1.</p>",
