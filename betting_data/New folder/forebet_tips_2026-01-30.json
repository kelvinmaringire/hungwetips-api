    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Bristol City take on Derby County at the Robins High Performance Centre in a contest that could prove pivotal for both sides’ ambitions in the Championship. As the teams meet for the 30th time this season, the significance of three points looms large between these two closely-ranked rivals.</p>\n<p>The last meeting between these sides finished level at Pride Park, with a 1-1 scoreline. Derby County took the lead through Scott Twine in the 35th minute, only for Bristol City's Carlton Morris to equalize late on at the 86th minute.</p>\n<p>In terms of performance, Bristol City looked the more active side with 11 total shots to Derby’s 5 and managed 3 shots on target compared to 2 for the hosts. However, Derby edged possession slightly with 52% and engaged in 36 dangerous attacks, closely matched by City’s 39.</p>\n<p>This previous encounter demonstrated the competitive balance between the sides. Bristol City's strong attacking intent and Derby’s efficiency highlight the tactical battle expected again in this fixture.</p>\n<p>Bristol City have collected 3 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses in their last 6, boasting a resolute defense with just 0.83 goals conceded per match. Their attack averages 2 goals per game, a figure that swells at home to 2.33 across the last three fixtures. The hosts also control games, holding an average of 58.67% possession in their latest trio at home.</p>\n<p>Derby County mirror City’s record with 3 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses in their last 6, but with a slightly less potent attack at 1.17 scored per match and a matching 1.17 conceded. Their away outings reveal a tendency to cede the ball, averaging only 47.67% possession in their last three road trips.</p>\n<p>Bristol City are sitting 7th in the Championship table with 12 wins, 7 draws, and 10 losses. Their 40 goals from 29 matches reflect a balanced attacking threat, while just 31 conceded speaks of a disciplined defensive setup. A +9 goal difference keeps them well-placed for a playoff push.</p>\n<p>Derby County follow close behind in 11th, with 11 wins, 9 draws, and 9 losses. They have almost matched City in goals for, scoring 39 in 29 matches, but their defense has leaked more, conceding 37 times and holding a much narrower +2 goal difference.</p>\n<p>Bristol City have produced an 83% undefeated record in their last 6 home matches in all competitions, highlighting the difficulty of leaving Bristol with anything. They have kept 7 clean sheets in their last 17 home matches and won by 2 or more goals in 50% of their last 12 at this venue. Over a broader sample—30 home league matches—they have collected victories in 57% of outings.</p>\n<p>Derby County have gone undefeated in 8 of their last 10 league matches, suggesting resilience and growing confidence. However, in their last 7 away Championship matches, they are winless in 6 of those 7, raising questions about consistency away from home.</p>\n<p>Bristol City are hampered by several key absentees: Jason Knight, Max Bird, Joe Williams, Luke McNally, Cameron Pring, and Ross McCrorie are all sidelined. Based on recent selection patterns and absentees, the likely setup is a 3-4-3.</p>\n<p>Bristol City</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Radek Vitek</p>\n<p>Defenders: Rob Atkinson, Rob Dickie, George Tanner</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Adam Randell, Mark Sykes, Neto Borges, Zak Vyner</p>\n<p>Attackers: Scott Twine, Emil Riis, Anis Mehmeti</p>\n<p>Derby County are set to miss Carlton Morris and backup goalkeeper Josh Vickers. The usual 4-2-3-1 formation should be maintained, with small tweaks based on recent lineups.</p>\n<p>Derby County</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jacob Widell Zetterström</p>\n<p>Defenders: Callum Elder, Matt Clarke, Sondre Langås, Joe Ward</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Lewis Travis, David Ozoh, Bobby Clark, Ben Brereton Díaz, Rhian Brewster</p>\n<p>Attacker: Patrick Agyemang</p>\n<p>With both teams having shown similar forms, but Bristol City boasting stronger home statistics and Derby struggling for away wins, the match promises to be tight. The algorithm favors Derby County for the win with a 37% probability, but Bristol City’s home advantage and resilient defense may provide a stiff challenge.</p>\n<p>Given these dynamics, a low-scoring and closely fought encounter is likely, mirroring the intensity and balance seen in their previous meeting.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">With both sides seeking stability in La Liga’s midseason battle, Espanyol welcomes Deportivo Alavés to the RCDE Stadium on January 30, 2026. Recent performances and tactical trends suggest a tightly contested match, with Espanyol appearing marginally more equipped to edge out their visitors in a low-scoring affair.</p>\n<p>Espanyol's encounters with Deportivo Alavés have leaned in favor of the hosts recently. Across the last six meetings, Espanyol secured four victories while suffering two defeats and drawing none. This 67% win rate underlines Espanyol’s ability to perform against Alavés, particularly on home soil.</p>\n<p>In those matchups, Espanyol have typically found ways to control the narrative, often seizing key moments to secure points, making this an important psychological factor as they approach this home fixture.</p>\n<p>Espanyol enter after a mixed stretch. Over their last six matches in all competitions, they have posted two wins, one draw and three losses. During this run, the side has averaged 1 goal scored and 1.5 goals conceded per game, highlighting some attacking issues.</p>\n<p>At home, the recent picture is slightly more concerning. Espanyol have won once and lost twice in their last three league matches at the RCDE Stadium, scoring just 0.33 goals per game and conceding 1.33. Their average possession in those matches has dropped to 39%, and shots on goal have dipped as well.</p>\n<p>Deportivo Alavés, meanwhile, mirror Espanyol's recent league record: two wins, one draw, and three defeats across their last six matches. Their attack has also struggled, netting 1 goal and conceding 1.5 per match. The most significant difference is in possession, with Alavés averaging over 51% both home and away – a strength, but not always translating to dominance on the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>Alavés’s away form has been particularly unsteady. In their last ten away games in all competitions, they have failed to win 80% of the time, recording a concerning nine losses in their past fifteen outings on the road. This vulnerability could be pivotal at the RCDE.</p>\n<p>Espanyol currently stand 5th in La Liga, with ten wins, four draws, and seven losses from 21 matches. They’ve scored exactly 25 goals and conceded just as many, with both for and against averaging 1.19 per match. The zero goal difference points to tight margins in most contests, often decided by one or two moments.</p>\n<p>Alavés hover further down in 17th, having won just six, drawing four, and losing eleven out of 21. Their 18 goals scored (0.86 per game) are among the lowest in the division, while conceding 1.24 per match leaves little margin for error. The negative goal difference of eight underlines their struggles to keep clean sheets and to mount comebacks.</p>\n<p>Looking at performance trends, Espanyol have won half of their past ten matches in all competitions, but have gone winless over their last four. At home, Espanyol have won 58% of their last twelve league games, maintaining an average of nearly 4.7 shots on goal. Defensively, there’s vulnerability: Espanyol have lost 43% of their last seven home games by two or more goals in La Liga.</p>\n<p>Alavés, on the other hand, show a worrying trend of being winless in 8 of their last 10 league matches and losing 50% of their last 22 games. Away from home, they have found no wins in 80% of their last ten. This lack of away success may weigh heavily on their approach.</p>\n<p>Espanyol</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper:</p>\n<p>Ángel Fortuño</p>\n<p>Defenders:<br/>Omar El Hilali, Carlos Romero, Fernando Calero, Carlos Romero</p>\n<p>Midfielders:<br/>Urko González de Zárate, Edu Expósito, Pol Lozano, Tyrhys Dolan</p>\n<p>Attackers:<br/>Pere Milla, Kike García</p>\n<p>Javi Puado is sidelined and excluded from the matchday squad.</p>\n<p>Deportivo Alavés</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper:<br/>Raúl Fernández</p>\n<p>Defenders:<br/>Nahuel Tenaglia, Jon Pacheco, Jonny Otto, Victor Parada</p>\n<p>Midfielders:<br/>Pablo Ibáñez, Antonio Blanco, Jon Guridi, Carles Aleñá, Abde Rebbach</p>\n<p>Attackers:<br/>Toni Martínez</p>\n<p>Facundo Garcés and Antonio Sivera remain unavailable due to suspension and injury, respectively.</p>\n<p>The statistical evidence and trends point to a close, low-scoring fixture. While neither side is prolific in front of goal, Espanyol’s home strength and recent dominance in this fixture gives them the edge. The probability favors Espanyol with a 57% chance of victory. Under 2.5 total goals seems likely, with Espanyol most probable to secure all three points with a 1-0 scoreline.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">After a dramatic six-goal encounter in the reverse fixture, Köln and Wolfsburg are set to meet again, both looking for stability in a turbulent Bundesliga campaign. With just three points separating the sides and midtable uncertainty hanging over both, every detail could be decisive this time around.</p>\n<p>The last meeting between Wolfsburg and Köln was nothing short of dramatic. The teams fought to a 3-3 draw, with momentum swinging throughout the match.</p>\n<p>Wolfsburg, playing at home, enjoyed 56% possession and took 14 shots, matching Köln’s tally. Despite their greater control, Köln created more dangerous moments, registering 44 dangerous attacks to Wolfsburg's 36 and edging shots on target with eight to the hosts' six.</p>\n<p>The scoring opened early through Luca Waldschmidt, while Majer, Amoura, Arnold, Kaminski and Jóhannesson all featured on the scoresheet in an end-to-end affair. Köln's resilience shone as they refused to yield, equalizing in the dying moments. The even numbers speak to two sides capable of exploiting each other’s weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Köln's recent results highlight inconsistency. With just one win, one draw and four losses in their last six outings, they have scored only once per match, yet conceded an average of 1.83. Their average of 14.17 shots per game signals an ability to create opportunities, though their conversion rate raises concerns.</p>\n<p>Wolfsburg, meanwhile, have posted two wins, a draw and three defeats over the same stretch, scoring at a 1.83 per game clip but struggling defensively, conceding three times per game on average. Away from home, their struggles continue, having lost two of their last three on the road with a worrying average of four goals conceded per match.</p>\n<p>Both sides are locked on 28 goals for this Bundesliga campaign, but defensive frailty separates them. Köln’s goal difference sits at minus four, a symptom of 32 goals conceded across 19 matches. Wolfsburg’s record is starker with a minus thirteen differential and 41 conceded, the second-worst in the league.</p>\n<p>Köln occupies tenth position, just ahead of twelfth-placed Wolfsburg by three points, each with five wins but the visitors have one more loss and one less draw over the campaign so far.</p>\n<p>Köln has lost seven of their last twelve in all competitions, with 83% of their last 18 matches winless. Their home difficulty continues, with five losses in their last ten at RheinEnergieSTADION.</p>\n<p>Wolfsburg’s form on the road is problematic, having lost 10 of their last 20 away matches and a notable 43% of their last seven by two or more goals. Their defensive vulnerabilities away from home may shape the gameplan.</p>\n<p><strong>Köln</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Marvin Schwäbe</p>\n<p>Defenders: Sebastian Sebulonsen, Rav van den Berg, Cenk Özkacar, Kristoffer Lund</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Tom Krauß, Jan Thielmann, Linton Maina, Eric Martel</p>\n<p>Attackers: Ragnar Ache, Marius Bülter</p>\n<p>Due to injuries, Luca Kilian, Timo Hübers, Dominique Heintz, Joël Schmied, Jakub Kamiński and Said El Mala are all absent for this fixture.</p>\n<p><strong>Wolfsburg</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Kamil Grabara</p>\n<p>Defenders: Moritz Jenz, Denis Vavro, Aaron Zehnter, Saël Kumbedi</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Christian Eriksen, Lovro Majer, Yannick Gerhardt, Patrick Wimmer</p>\n<p>Attackers: Dzenan Pejcinovic, Mohamed Amoura</p>\n<p>Wolfsburg’s defensive selection is limited by the absences of Konstantinos Koulierakis, Joakim Maehle, Rogério, Bence Dárdai, Jenson Seelt and Jonas Wind.</p>\n<p>With home advantage and a slightly more stable back line in recent games, Köln may hold the edge. Their ability to create chances and capitalize on Wolfsburg’s away weaknesses could see them take three points.</p>\n<p>According to statistical algorithms, Köln is favoured with a 37% probability of victory, possibly by a 2-1 margin, though goals at both ends seem likely based on both teams’ recent defensive performances.</p>\n<p>Past meetings suggest another close contest, with neither side able to sustain winning momentum in recent outings. Small details, such as defensive lapses or efficiency in front of goal, could tip the balance.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">With both Lazio and Genoa searching for momentum as Serie A moves past the halfway stage, this encounter in Rome has plenty on the line. The Stadio Olimpico sets the stage for two sides well-acquainted and eager to tip the balance after a draw in the prediction stakes.</p>\n<p>Lazio enter the match looking to translate their defensive solidity into points, especially at home, while Genoa hope to build on their current run of five matches undefeated in all competitions.</p>\n<p>The last time these teams faced each other, Lazio thoroughly outclassed Genoa on the road with a strong 3-0 victory. Despite Genoa holding a commanding 65% of possession and generating 17 shots to Lazio's 9, the Biancocelesti were ruthless in front of goal, with Matteo Cancellieri, Taty Castellanos, and Mattia Zaccagni finding the net. Genoa had more shots on target (5 to Lazio's 6), yet struggled to convert, while Lazio made the most of their opportunities, especially during dangerous attacks where they actually led 49 to 36.</p>\n<p>For the season, Lazio occupy 9th place after 22 matches, drawing 8 and winning 7, with a modest output of 21 goals scored and 19 conceded. Their goal difference sits positive, but slim, at +2. Recent form highlights a struggle for wins with just one victory in their past six. Moreover, they have been winless in 6 of their last 7 matches in all competitions and have seen 5 clean sheets from their last 12 home league fixtures.</p>\n<p>At the Olimpico, the hosts have found life tough, drawing one and losing two of their latest three appearances. They average only 0.67 goals per home match in this stretch, while conceding 2.33. Despite enjoying nearly 50% possession over their last six matches overall, that number drops sharply to less than 40% at home, further highlighting their need to control midfield tempo.</p>\n<p>Recent head-to-head meetings heavily favor Lazio. In their last three clashes with Genoa, they have picked up decisive wins, each by a margin of at least two goals. However, in Serie A matches alone, Lazio have not tasted victory in 8 of their past 10 outings – a reminder that form in direct encounters hasn’t always translated to broader consistency.</p>\n<p>Genoa are positioned 16th in the standings, tallying 25 goals while conceding 31, leaving them with a -6 goal difference after 22 matches. The Ligurians have navigated their last six matches without defeat in 5, drawing 3 and scoring an average of 1.5 goals per outing. Away from home, however, troubles persist: Genoa have lost 5 of their previous 10 Serie A travels, and failed to earn a win in 9 of their last 11 away days.</p>\n<p>Still, Genoa's current form does warrant some attention. In all competitions, their 50% draw rate across the last six and a propensity for tight contests could spell difficulty for Lazio’s attack, especially considering the Biancocelesti's recent struggles to score.</p>\n<p>Sidelined players may play a part in shaping the lineups, too. For Lazio, Patric, Samuel Gigot, and Nicolò Rovella are all unavailable. Genoa are missing only Caleb Ekuban from the previous squads due to his hamstring injury.</p>\n<p>Probable Lineups:</p>\n<p><strong>Lazio</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Ivan Provedel</p>\n<p>Defenders: Adam Marusic, Alessio Romagnoli, Mario Gila, Luca Pellegrini</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Kenneth Taylor, Danilo Cataldi, Matías Vecino</p>\n<p>Attackers: Mattia Zaccagni, Matteo Cancellieri, Tijjani Noslin</p>\n<p><strong>Genoa</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Nicola Leali</p>\n<p>Defenders: Leo Østigård, Johan Vásquez, Alessandro Marcandalli</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Brooke Norton-Cuffy, Aarón Martín, Morten Frendrup, Mikael Egill Ellertsson, Ruslan Malinovskyi</p>\n<p>Attackers: Vitinha, Lorenzo Colombo</p>\n<p>The predicted formation points to Lazio sticking with their usual 4-3-3, looking for more fluidity up front, while Genoa retain their 3-5-2, banking on structure and counterattacks.</p>\n<p>Taking all statistical cues into account, models lean toward a draw, with a 40% probability and a likely 1-1 scoreline. Lazio will be aiming to break their sequence of winless matches, but Genoa’s resilience in recent outings and solid record in away draws could well hold firm. It promises a tactical battle with little margin for error as both clubs seek stability heading into the crucial matches ahead.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">A confident Lens side welcomes Le Havre to Turf Moor, aiming to consolidate their strong league position while their visitors search for much-needed consistency. With previous encounters fresh in memory, this match offers an opportunity for both teams to make a statement.</p>\n<p>Lens enter this fixture in commanding form, sitting second in Ligue 1 after 19 rounds, having secured 14 wins, 1 draw, and only 4 defeats. Their defensive solidity and ability to produce consistent results have marked them out as one of the league's most reliable sides.</p>\n<p>Le Havre, on the other hand, find themselves in 15th place, battling to piece together a pattern of results that can pull them safely clear from the lower reaches of the table. They have collected just 4 wins, 8 draws, and 7 losses, underlining the inconsistency that's plagued their campaign so far.</p>\n<p>The sides last met on August 24, 2025, a meeting that saw Lens claim a narrow 2-1 victory on Le Havre's ground. Wesley Saïd converted a penalty early, Rayan Fofana responded for the hosts before the interval, but Fodé Doucouré found the winner soon after the break. Despite enjoying 57% possession, 18 total shots, and 67 dangerous attacks, Le Havre struggled to convert their attacking pressure into goals, while Lens made the most of their more limited opportunities: just 6 shots and 3 on target, yet two of them found the net.</p>\n<p>This efficiency in front of goal is reflected in Lens's recent home form, notching 3 wins from their last 3 at Turf Moor. They averaged 2 goals scored per match and conceded just 0.33, while also maintaining an average of 57.33% ball possession and 19 total shots per match—numbers that underline their ability to dictate proceedings on familiar turf.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Le Havre's form away from home remains a concern. They've managed just 1 win in their last 6 matches across all venues, scoring a meagre 0.5 goals per game while conceding 0.83 on average. Their output drops further in recent away games, reflected in an average of 41.33% possession and just under 10 shots per match.</p>\n<p>A key trend underpinning this matchup is Lens's resilience: they haven't been defeated in 87% of their last 15 matches across all competitions, and they boast clean sheets in 45% of their last 20 home games. Furthermore, Lens have won by a margin of 2 or more goals in 38% of their last 26 matches, and have triumphed in 10 of their previous 12 Ligue 1 fixtures, asserting their status as favorites.</p>\n<p>Le Havre's struggles are evident in their own trends. They haven't won in 12 of their last 15 matches overall and are winless in 13 of their previous 16 Ligue 1 outings. While they have claimed three consecutive undefeated matches recently, finding the net has been their chief difficulty, averaging less than a goal per game over the campaign.</p>\n<p>Examining probable lineups, Lens are likely to deploy a familiar 3-4-2-1 setup, incorporating key performers from their recent strong run. Expect:</p>\n<p>Lens<br/> Goalkeeper: Robin Risser<br/> Defenders: Nidal Celik, Malang Sarr, Ismaëlo Ganiou<br/> Midfielders: Matthieu Udol, Adrien Thomasson, Saud Abdulhamid, Andrija Bulatovic<br/> Attackers: Wesley Saïd, Florian Thauvin, Odsonne Édouard</p>\n<p>Le Havre<br/> Goalkeeper: Lionel Mpasi-Nzau<br/> Defenders: Lucas Gourna-Douath, Ayumu Seko, Arouna Sangante, Yanis Zouaoui<br/> Midfielders: Rassoul Ndiaye, Simon Ebonog, Yassine Kechta<br/> Attackers: Kenny Quetant, Issa Soumaré, Felix Mambimbi</p>\n<p>The absence of major sidelined players allows both teams to field their best available elevens, keeping tactical options open for their coaches. Lens’s stability and strength in attack and midfield hands them a clear advantage, particularly against a Le Havre side with a timid record on the road.</p>\n<p>Lens’s dominance in head-to-heads and their run of home victories point to another solid performance. Le Havre's difficulty in converting chances and defensive lapses away from home suggest their search for consistency will continue.</p>\n<p>The prediction for under 2.5 goals seems grounded: Lens rarely concede and often edge matches by small margins. A 1-0 home victory for Lens, with a 52% estimated probability, fits the balance of probabilities on recent evidence.</p>\n<p>If Lens can maintain their focused home displays and clinical finishing, another three points appear firmly within their grasp.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Estádio Dom Afonso Henriques is set to host another Liga Portugal fixture, with Vitória welcoming Moreirense FC. Both sides are seeking to solidify their spots in the league table, and their form gives little away about which team could emerge with three points.</p>\n<p>Vitória’s last six league matches have resulted in three wins, one draw, and two defeats. Offensively, they've averaged 1.33 goals per game while conceding at the same rate, hinting at a balance between attack and defense. In front of their own supporters, the results are similar, picking up two wins from their previous three, with just a single loss.</p>\n<p>Moreirense FC, likewise, have taken three wins, one draw, and two losses from their recent six outings in all competitions. Notably, they are less prolific in front of goal, netting an average of 0.83 per match, while maintaining a relatively robust back line, conceding just one goal per game.</p>\n<p>The home advantage could play a role in this clash. Vitória haven't been defeated in their last six home matches against Moreirense FC, boasting four wins and two draws in that period. This trend has given the hosts a clear psychological edge at Estádio Dom Afonso Henriques when facing their next opponents.</p>\n<p>After 19 rounds of the regular season, Vitória sit in ninth place with seven wins, four draws, and eight defeats. Their attack has produced 20 goals while shipping 27, leading to a negative goal difference of minus seven. Moreirense FC hold sixth place, collecting nine wins, three draws, and seven losses, with both 26 goals scored and conceded, showing greater efficiency up front but also some vulnerability in defense.</p>\n<p>For Vitória, the statistical overview paints a mixed picture. Of their last 24 matches across all competitions, they've managed 12 victories, registering an average of 4.13 shots on target and just under 50% possession. However, they have lost four of their past eight, suggesting some inconsistency. Cleaning up at the back remains a challenge, with clean sheets in only 40% of the last 30 home games.</p>\n<p>Moreirense’s away form raises questions, having failed to win in eight of the last ten outings away from home. Despite this, they do manage to keep clean sheets in 42% of their last 12 away fixtures, and in the last 20 away games, 60% have ended in defeat for them. Their efficiency in front of goal remains slightly below average in away matches.</p>\n<p>Vitória</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Juan Castillo</p>\n<p>Defenders: Maga, Miguel Nóbrega, Rodrigo Abascal, João Mendes</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Samu, Telmo Arcanjo, Gonçalo Nogueira, Noah Jose Saviolo, Beni Mukendi</p>\n<p>Attackers: Nélson Oliveira</p>\n<p>Moreirense FC</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: André Ferreira</p>\n<p>Defenders: Álvaro Martínez Navarro, Jóbson de Brito Gonzaga, Dinis Lourenço Casals Namura Borges Pinto, Michel Augusto Modesto Rafael dos Santos</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Travassos, Alan de Souza Guimarães, Rodrigo Alonso Martín, Afonso Assis Cunha Almeida</p>\n<p>Attackers: Luís Semedo, Francisco Tomé Tavares Bondoso</p>\n<p>Vitória are missing Gustavo Silva and Óscar Rivas, both sidelined with muscle injuries. Moreirense FC have Vasco Sousa out due to a broken fibula. These absences could influence tactical choices, particularly for Vitória, who must manage without Silva’s attacking contributions.</p>\n<p>Both teams approach this contest with parallel form lines and defensive strengths. Vitória's strong home record against Moreirense suggests a slight advantage, but the visitors' ability to pick up results away makes this difficult to call outright. The predicted outcome is a draw, with a 34% probability and a likely score of 1-1.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">NAC Breda will be hoping to turn their fortunes around when they welcome Twente to the Rat Verlegh Stadion on January 30th in Eredivisie regular-season action. With Twente on an impressive undefeated streak and Breda desperate for a revival, the match carries plenty of importance in the standings.</p>\n<p>NAC Breda's recent history against Twente shows a fairly even contest, with one win, two draws, and two losses over their last five encounters. While neither side dominated those duels, Breda are in the midst of a tough stretch at the moment.</p>\n<p>Looking at Breda's last six matches in all competitions, the team has struggled for results with three draws and three defeats. Notably, they have scored just one goal per game on average during this period while conceding 1.5, which points to ongoing problems at both ends of the pitch.</p>\n<p>At home, the situation is similar. Breda have not managed a win in their last three outings at the Rat Verlegh Stadion, picking up a draw and suffering two defeats, conceding twice per game on average. Their home form over the last ten matches has produced wins in just 20% of games and they remain winless in 80% of those fixtures.</p>\n<p>More concerning is the team's lengthy winless streak – Breda have not secured victory in any of their last nine games across all competitions. Extending further back, they have failed to win in 14 of their previous 15 overall matches and have lost 11 of their last 20, highlighting inescapable struggles.</p>\n<p>Twente's campaign so far paints a much brighter picture. John van den Brom's side sit eighth in the table after 20 games, having lost just four times and boasting a solid goal difference of plus seven. Their last six matches have yielded three wins and three draws, with an average of two goals scored per game and only one conceded. Shot metrics also favor Twente as they register 23.17 total shots and 8.5 on goal per match on average in this span, a considerable threat to any opposition.</p>\n<p>The away form has also been noteworthy. Twente are undefeated in their last 12 games on the road in all competitions, with wins in half of those. They have also managed to keep clean sheets frequently and are undefeated in 82% of their last 11 Eredivisie matches away from home, showing real steel outside of Enschede.</p>\n<p>Twente come into this fixture amid a 13-match unbeaten streak in all competitions, underlining their consistency and solidity. They have also ended level in eight of their last 12 Eredivisie matches and have been hard to break down, conceding just 1.1 goals per game across the season.</p>\n<p>Squad selection will be a factor for both sides. NAC Breda are missing Fredrik Oldrup Jensen due to a knee injury, while Twente are set to do without Issam El Maach, Sam Lammers, and Mees Hilgers, all sidelined long term. Recent lineups suggest Breda will opt for a 4-2-3-1 formation, with regular selections in defense and midfield.</p>\n<p><strong>NAC Breda Probable Lineup</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Daniel Bielica</p>\n<p>Defenders: Denis Odoi, Leo Greiml, Rio Hillen, Boy Kemper</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Kamal Sowah, Max Balard, Lewis Holtby, Charles-Andreas Brym, Moussa Soumano</p>\n<p>Attackers: Sydney van Hooijdonk</p>\n<p><strong>Twente Probable Lineup</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Lars Unnerstall</p>\n<p>Defenders: Robin Pröpper, Bart van Rooij, Mats Rots, Stav Lemkin</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Ramiz Zerrouki, Kristian Hlynsson, Sondre Ørjasæter, Daan Rots, Thomas van den Belt</p>\n<p>Attackers: Ricky van Wolfswinkel</p>\n<p>With the form book so heavily favoring Twente, forecasts indicate an expected away win, most likely by 1-2, and over 2.5 total goals in the match. Twente’s probability for victory sits at 44%, giving them the upper hand. NAC Breda, with a lengthy winless streak and defensive vulnerability, will need a determined performance to disrupt the visitors’ momentum.</p>",
