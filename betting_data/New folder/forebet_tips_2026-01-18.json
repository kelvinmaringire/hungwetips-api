    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">As Newcastle United head to Molineux Stadium to face Wolverhampton, the numbers on each side paint a portrait of two very different Premier League campaigns so far. While Newcastle are in pursuit of European places, Wolves have found wins hard to come by, sitting at the foot of the table with a challenging record to counter.</p>\n<p>Wolverhampton's last six matches tell a story of frustration, with just one victory, two draws, and three defeats. They've managed an average of 1.17 goals scored per game while conceding 1.33, and their attacking output has been modest, averaging just 9.17 shots per match. At Molineux, the challenges have persisted: losing two of their last three at home and conceding an average of two goals in those fixtures.</p>\n<p>Newcastle, on the other hand, come into this encounter off the back of a much stronger run. Four wins, one draw and only a single loss from their last six matches is buoyed further by a healthy average of 2.17 goals scored per game. Their shooting numbers, with an average of 15.17 total shots and 6.33 on target per game, reflect an attacking side not frequently subdued. Their ball possession sits at 58% on average – a stark contrast to Wolves’ 39.67% in recent outings.</p>\n<p>The last ten meetings between these two teams have seen Newcastle hold the advantage, winning six and drawing three, while Wolves have managed just one victory. Further digging reveals Newcastle have won the last three meetings and have taken two of the last five by a margin of two or more goals. Wolverhampton have been unable to find answers in this clash, which may weigh on their approach.</p>\n<p>In the Premier League table, Newcastle occupy sixth place, having won nine, drawn five, and lost seven. They have a positive goal difference and average 1.52 goals per game, conceding 1.29. Wolverhampton’s struggles are clear: positioned twentieth with just one win, four draws and sixteen defeats. Only fifteen goals scored across 21 games highlights their difficulties in attack, while the backline has leaked 41 goals.</p>\n<p>For Wolves, the main statistical trends offer further insight into a challenging season. They've been winless in 83% of their last 30 matches and have lost 67% of those encounters. At home, 12 losses in their last 15 matches underscores their vulnerability at Molineux. Notably, Wolves have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last three against Newcastle.</p>\n<p>Newcastle present a remarkably different trend. They're undefeated in 9 of their last 11 and have won half of their last 30 matches in all competitions. Solid defensive improvements are reflected in six clean sheets over their last 15 home Premier League matches, while offensively, their tally of 20 wins from the last 40 league matches suggests consistency.</p>\n<p>Wolverhampton Wanderers (likely 3-5-2):</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: José Sá</p>\n<p>Defenders: Matt Doherty, Santiago Bueno, Yerson Mosquera, Ladislav Krejci</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Hugo Bueno, João Gomes, Jhon Arias, Mateus Mané, Jackson Tchatchoua</p>\n<p>Attackers: Hee-chan Hwang, Tolu Arokodare</p>\n<p>Newcastle United (likely 4-3-3):</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Nick Pope</p>\n<p>Defenders: Lewis Hall, Sven Botman, Malick Thiaw, Lewis Miley</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Jacob Ramsey, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães</p>\n<p>Attackers: Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, Yoane Wissa</p>\n<p>In this contest, the statistical weight carries towards Newcastle United, given their recent performance, historical dominance in this fixture, and the superior balance between defense and attack. Wolverhampton's issues both home and away place them as significant underdogs, with only one win from 21 league matches and conceding nearly two goals per game.</p>\n<p>The match algorithm predicts over 2.5 goals, with a probable 1-2 win for Newcastle, who are given a 55% chance to claim all three points. It would be a surprise if Wolves could break their negative streak against an organized Newcastle side firing on all cylinders.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Getafe host Valencia at the Coliseum Alfonso Pérez with both sides eager to stop their own downward trends and spark a return to form. Judging by the season's performances and the most recent clash, a closely fought contest is in prospect.</p>\n<p>The last meeting between Valencia and Getafe was one both sides will remember for contrasting reasons. Valencia, at home, dominated on the scoreboard with a 3-0 victory. The scoreline, though, didn’t quite tell the whole story.</p>\n<p>Despite the final result, Getafe outshot their hosts 11 to 7 and registered more dangerous attacks, 43 compared to 26. Valencia held the majority of possession, clocking in at 58%, and were clinical with their chances — converting four shots on target into three goals, including strikes from Mouctar Diakhaby (30’), Arnaut Danjuma (54’), and Hugo Duro deep in stoppage time (97’).</p>\n<p>This outcome extended Valencia's recent good run against Getafe and set the tone for their psychological edge heading into the rematch.</p>\n<p>Getafe sit 13th after 19 La Liga games, showing a record of 6 wins, 3 draws, and 10 defeats, with a goal difference of -10. They have managed only 15 goals all season, an average of 0.79 per match, while conceding 25 at 1.32 per game.</p>\n<p>Down in 18th, Valencia have only 3 wins alongside 8 draws and 8 losses, but boast a slightly better goalscoring record with 18 goals, averaging 0.95 per match. Defensively, they have conceded 31, the joint-highest in the bottom six.</p>\n<p>Getafe have struggled for momentum, failing to secure a win in 7 consecutive matches and losing 9 of their last 15 in all competitions. Winless in 80% of their last 15 league games and 82% in their last 11 across all competitions reflects ongoing challenges in offensive productivity and defensive consistency.</p>\n<p>Their home form is also mixed, with 1 win in 3, and an average of only 0.67 goals scored in that stretch. Notably, defeats tend to be heavier — 43% of their last 7 losses were by 2 or more goals.</p>\n<p>Valencia bring their own issues, winless in 3 in all competitions and without a win in 80% of their last 25. Their strong suit is their ability to avoid defeat: unbeaten in 8 of the last 10 matches. They also draw half of their recent 12 matches, a sign of resilience even if wins remain elusive.</p>\n<p>Getafe have just 1 point from their last 6 league games, with an average of 0.5 goals scored and 2.17 conceded per match. Shot production and possession are both below league average, with 10 attempts and 47.67% possession.</p>\n<p>Valencia, meanwhile, have managed a single win from their last six but score at a higher clip (1.17 per match) and concede slightly less (1.5). Their shot production and possession stand out, averaging 14 shots and 56.17% possession — a sign they are sometimes in control, but not clinical enough in front of goal.</p>\n<p><strong>Getafe</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: David Soria</p>\n<p>Defenders: Dakonam Djené, Juan Iglesias, Domingos Duarte, Diego Rico</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Luis Milla, Javi Muñoz, Adrián Liso, Mario Martín</p>\n<p>Attackers: Kiko Femenía, Álex Sancris</p>\n<p><strong>Valencia</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Stole Dimitrievski</p>\n<p>Defenders: José Copete, César Tárrega, Thierry Correia, José Gayà</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Pepelu, André Almeida, Filip Ugrinic, Luis Rioja, Diego López</p>\n<p>Attackers: Lucas Beltrán</p>\n<p>Both teams arrive with several key players sidelined. For Getafe, Allan Nyom, Davinchi, Borja Mayoral, Abdel Abqar, and Mauro Arambarri are unavailable, limiting rotation and depth. Valencia miss Mouctar Diakhaby, Eray Cömert, Julen Agirrezabala, and Javi Guerra, impacting both defense and midfield creativity.</p>\n<p>The underlying stats point toward a tightly contested affair. Getafe’s defensive struggles at home are matched by Valencia’s inability to turn possession into points on the road. With both sides rarely finding the net with consistency and multiple draws characterizing recent matches, a stalemate feels like a logical outcome.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Draw, probability 40% — 1-1 scoreline expected based on current trends and availability.</p>",
