    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">West Bromwich prepare to host Middlesbrough at The Hawthorns in a Championship matchup that promises a battle of defensive resilience against creative firepower. With both sides coming off contrasting spells in form, the stage is set for an encounter where every detail might prove decisive as the season progresses.</p>\n<p>When West Bromwich and Middlesbrough face off at The Hawthorns, recent seasons have produced competitive contests. In the last three home matches against Middlesbrough, West Bromwich have claimed two wins and suffered a single defeat, suggesting a slight edge when playing on their own turf. However, over the past six fixtures at The Hawthorns, West Bromwich have lost three, highlighting Middlesbrough's ability to challenge away from home.</p>\n<p>Looking further into the home fixtures split, it is notable that West Bromwich have managed to celebrate two wins by a margin of two or more goals in their last five meetings at home against Middlesbrough, demonstrating their occasional flair when it clicks.</p>\n<p>West Bromwich's last six matches reflect a side searching for consistency. With two wins and four losses, the Baggies have struggled to generate attacking fluidity, netting just once in those six outings, yet have maintained defensive discipline by conceding an average of 1.17 goals per match. The numbers at The Hawthorns, though, are somewhat more encouraging. In their last three home league matches, West Bromwich have won two and lost one, scoring 1.67 and conceding only a single goal on average per contest.</p>\n<p>Middlesbrough's recent form may be more balanced, with two wins, one draw, and three losses in their previous six. What's striking, however, is how miserly their defense has been; they’ve let in just 0.83 goals per game in that stretch. Their ability to dominate possession stands out as well, commanding an average of over 63% during this period. Yet, their away form in the last three sees them slip to a single win paired with two losses, and a goal average that dips to just 0.67 scored.</p>\n<p>Position in the standings dictates the mood around each camp. West Bromwich, currently 18th, have taken nine wins and four draws from 26 matches, with a negative goal difference at minus six after conceding 35 and scoring 29. Consistency at home is underscored by an undefeated streak in 16 of their last 20, but the lack of clean sheets and goals remains a concern.</p>\n<p>Middlesbrough, meanwhile, sit in second place and appear well-placed for promotion contention. Their 13 wins and seven draws in 26 games have led to a positive goal difference of plus eleven. Having scored 37 and conceded 26, they are more potent in attack and notably tighter at the back, underscored by just a single goal conceded per match on average.</p>\n<p>West Bromwich’s historical trends indicate a side with fluctuating fortunes, losing exactly half of their last 36 games across all competitions. Despite this, they've held strong at home, with a 50% win rate and being undefeated in 16 of their last 20 matches at The Hawthorns. Conversely, Middlesbrough have demonstrated fortitude, with 6 wins in their previous 12 matches across all fronts, but have also lost as many as they’ve won over their last six outings.</p>\n<p><b>West Bromwich</b></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Joe Wildsmith</p>\n<p>Defenders: Nat Phillips, Callum Styles, George Campbell, Charlie Taylor</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Karlan Grant, Mikey Johnston, Ousmane Diakité, Samuel Iling-Junior, Alex Mowatt</p>\n<p>Attackers: Aune Heggebø</p>\n<p><b>Middlesbrough</b></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Sol Brynn</p>\n<p>Defenders: Callum Brittain, Matt Targett, Luke Ayling, Alex Bangura</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Hayden Hackney, Alan Browne, Morgan Whittaker, Tommy Conway</p>\n<p>Attackers: Kaly Sène, Delano Burgzorg</p>\n<p>On balance, Middlesbrough's robust defensive numbers and greater attacking output away from home grant them a slight advantage. West Bromwich, while tough to break down at home, have struggled to find the net, with attacking output among the lowest in recent matches. The game looks likely to be cagey, with both sides set up to minimize risks. The probability of a Middlesbrough win stands at 39%, and it shapes up for another low-scoring contest, with the prediction leaning towards under 2.5 goals and a likely 0-2 away scoreline in favour of Middlesbrough.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">The clash between Espanyol and Girona arrives with both teams searching for a crucial three points. With Espanyol riding a strong home record and Girona aiming to overturn recent struggles, all eyes will be on the battle lines drawn at RCDE Stadium on January 16, 2026.</p>\n<p>Espanyol come into this fixture sitting fifth in the La Liga standings after 19 matches. Their tally stands at 10 wins, 4 draws, and 5 defeats, tallying 23 goals for and conceding just 20. This consistency has given them a goal difference of +3 and an average of 1.21 goals scored per match, while remaining quite sturdy at the back.</p>\n<p>Over the last six matches in all competitions, Espanyol have registered 3 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses, with both their goals scored and conceded per game sitting at 0.83. At home, they’ve kept things tighter, with 2 wins and just 1 loss in their last 3 outings, where they’ve averaged a goal per game.</p>\n<p>Turning to Girona, their current run has them in 11th place, reflecting a more mixed performance this season. After 19 games, Girona have recorded 5 wins, 6 draws, and 8 losses. Offensively, they’ve averaged less than a goal per match, with 18 scored and 34 conceded, resulting in a worrying goal difference of -16 and suggesting defensive vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Girona’s last six matches in all competitions have yielded 3 wins and 3 losses. The goals conceded statistic is more concerning: 1.67 per match over that period, compared to just a single goal scored on average. On the road, their trends are worrying—they have been winless in 10 of their last 12 away matches, highlighting difficulty in collecting points outside of Montilivi.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on their previous encounter, both sides delivered a tightly contested 0-0 draw back in September 2025 at Girona’s home ground. Espanyol unleashed 20 total shots to Girona's 12, and enjoyed more chances on goal (5 to 3). However, Girona dominated possession with 60% and edged in dangerous attacks (53 to Espanyol’s 41). Despite the attractive play, neither side found the breakthrough that day, a testament to evenly matched approaches and resolute defending on both sides.</p>\n<p>Looking at longer-term trends, Espanyol boast an impressive undefeated streak at home, staying unbeaten in 80% of their last 40 matches in all competitions. In La Liga, they also have been undefeated in 86% of their last 7, while winning half of their most recent 14 league fixtures.</p>\n<p>Conversely, Girona’s away statistics reveal significant challenges. Not only have they lost 50% of their last 12 away in all competitions, they remain winless in 83% of those matches. Their defensive issues are underscored by 34 goals conceded in the league—remarkably the second-highest among the top 15 sides.</p>\n<p>For Espanyol, stability has been key with José González Álvarez typically favouring a 4-2-3-1 setup in recent matches. Keeping injuries in mind, their probable lineup for this match is expected as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Espanyol</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Marko Dmitrovic</p>\n<p>Defenders: Omar El Hilali, Fernando Calero, Leandro Cabrera, Carlos Romero</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Urko González de Zárate, Pol Lozano, Edu Expósito, Pere Milla, Tyrhys Dolan</p>\n<p>Attackers: Roberto Fernández</p>\n<p>Girona, managed by Míchel, will be forced to cope without Juan Carlos, Portu, Azzedine Ounahi, and Donny van de Beek, all sidelined by injury. Girona have shuffled personnel but are most likely to maintain their recent shape, deploying a 4-2-3-1 system as well. The projected lineup is:</p>\n<p><strong>Girona</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Paulo Gazzaniga</p>\n<p>Defenders: Álex Moreno, Daley Blind, Vitor Reis, Arnau Martínez</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Axel Witsel, Iván Martín, Viktor Tsygankov, Thomas Lemar, Bryan Gil</p>\n<p>Attackers: Vladyslav Vanat</p>\n<p>With Espanyol strong at home and Girona leaking goals, the prediction leans toward the home side taking all three points. Espanyol have a 38% chance of victory, bolstered by their consistent home displays and Girona's defensive frailties. A 2-1 scoreline is predicted as Espanyol aim to further cement their top-five position in the league.</p>",
