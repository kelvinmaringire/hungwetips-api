    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Levante hosts Elche at the Estadio Ciudad de Valencia in what shapes up as a pivotal fixture for both sides’ ambitions. With Elche pushing to consolidate a top-half place and Levante desperate for points to climb away from the bottom, each possession could prove crucial.</p>\n<p>Both teams have a rich recent history when playing each other in Valencia. Levante, specifically, has enjoyed an unbeaten run in their last five home matches against Elche, recording three wins and two draws. This record might serve as a confidence boost for the home side as they look to snap their current league woes.</p>\n<p>Levante’s present form is worrying. Across their last six matches in all competitions, they’ve managed a single victory, drawing twice and losing three times. With only 0.83 goals scored per match and conceding 1.17, the attack has struggled for consistency, reflecting their difficulties in the league.</p>\n<p>Home performances have not provided much respite either. In their last three outings at Estadio Ciudad de Valencia, Levante have failed to register a win, ending twice in a stalemate and succumbing to one defeat. The side is averaging less than a goal per home game and typically yielding just under 50% possession, questioning their ability to impose themselves even on home turf.</p>\n<p>Levante’s larger sample of league results paints a stark picture. Currently 19th, they have just three wins alongside five draws and eleven losses from nineteen matches. Having scored 21 and conceded 32, their negative goal difference of minus eleven highlights defensive vulnerabilities that have plagued them all season.</p>\n<p>The trends reinforce this narrative. Levante have lost 50% of their last 20 matches in all competitions and have gone winless in 9 of their last 11. At home, 82% of their past eleven matches ended without victory, though their long-term home record remains stubbornly hard to crack, with only six losses in their last 30 home encounters across all competitions.</p>\n<p>Elche, meanwhile, stands at a much healthier eighth position in the table, with 20 games yielding five wins, nine draws and six losses. Their 27 goals scored, compared to 26 conceded, have resulted in a narrow but positive goal difference, suggesting a side capable of both scoring and leaking goals.</p>\n<p>Recent form is mixed for Elche. They have claimed two wins, drawn twice and lost twice in their last six overall, alongside a minor drop-off in away results: winless in 10 of their previous 12 away games in all competitions. The attack remains relatively productive, with 1.67 goals per match in their last six, and maintaining over 57% average possession.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Elche have not won any of their last four matches in any competition. Defensively, they average conceding slightly more than a goal per game, a trend that Levante’s misfiring forwards will seek to exploit.</p>\n<p>Levante’s inconsistency is evident both in all competitions and specifically in the league, where they have gone winless in 80% of their last 15. Elche’s lengthy winless run on their travels suggests vulnerability on the road, but draws have been a common outcome. Levante’s resilience at home might clash with Elche's relatively astute midfield play.</p>\n<p>Levante has been particularly tough to beat at home over a long period, being undefeated in 24 of the past 30 home games, but their inability to secure frequent wins is apparent. Elche, for their part, have collected half of their away losses from the last 12 road trips and have gone winless in 12 of their last 15 in the league when away, which could influence tactical conservatism.</p>\n<p>Levante</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Mathew Ryan<br/>Defenders: Jeremy Toljan, Adrián Dela, Diego Pampín, Matías Moreno<br/>Midfielders: Pablo Martínez, Kervin Arriaga, Iker Losada, Carlos Álvarez, Kareem Tunde<br/>Attackers: Iván Romero</p>\n<p>Elche</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Iñaki Peña<br/>Defenders: Léo Pétrot, Víctor Chust, David Affengruber<br/>Midfielders: Marc Aguado, Germán Valera, Aleix Febas, Álvaro Núñez, Martim Neto<br/>Attackers: Álvaro Rodríguez, Grady Diangana</p>\n<p>The data and respective forms point toward a balanced contest. With Levante’s resilience at home and both sides showing a tendency for draws and narrow-scoring affairs recently, a stalemate appears likely. Algorithmic projection supports this, giving a 38% probability for a draw, most probably at 1-1. The key could well be who wins the midfield battle and which side takes their chances.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">The Millerntor-Stadion is set for a competitive showdown as St Pauli host Hamburger SV. Both teams are desperate for points near the lower end of the Bundesliga table, and recent statistics suggest a tightly contested encounter is in store.</p>\n<p>St Pauli have experienced mixed fortunes in their last six matches, managing two victories, two stalemates and two defeats. They average 1.33 goals both scored and conceded per match in this stretch, highlighting a lack of consistency at both ends of the pitch.</p>\n<p>Recent home form paints a challenging picture for Alexander Blessin's side. In their last three games at Millerntor, St Pauli took only three points, losing the other two, and managed just 0.67 goals per match while conceding 2. Their shooting numbers at home remain respectable, with over 12 attempts per match and nearly four on target, showing promise but a need for improved finishing.</p>\n<p>Hamburger SV, guided by Merlin Polzin, also come into this match searching for answers. Over their last six fixtures, HSV have just one victory, drawing three and losing two, with an average of one goal scored and 1.5 conceded per game. When playing away, they have struggled, with no wins and three defeats in their last three games, scoring an average of 0.67 goals and conceding over two. HSV do fire off plenty of attempts, averaging over 15 shots and more than six on target per away match, but their conversion rate remains problematic.</p>\n<p>St Pauli and Hamburger SV share a fierce local rivalry, and the historical narrative leans toward the hosts when it comes to Millerntor. St Pauli have celebrated victory four times in their last six home duels against HSV, with one draw and only a single defeat. Perhaps most notably, they’ve won two of the previous five home meetings by a margin of two or more goals, underlying their potential to deliver strong performances in this fixture.</p>\n<p>After 17 league matches, both teams find themselves in need of points. St Pauli sit at the bottom – 18th place – with a record of three wins, three draws, and eleven losses. Their attack struggles (16 goals scored, less than one per game), while the defense has been breached 31 times for a double-digit negative goal difference.</p>\n<p>Hamburger SV occupy 14th in the standings, having secured four wins and five draws from 17 outings. Their offense is marginally better than St Pauli’s but still only provides an average of just one goal per match. Defensively, HSV have allowed 27 goals, giving them a slightly better goal difference.</p>\n<p>St Pauli have lost 20 of their last 40 in all competitions and have been winless in 16 of their last 20 games. Their home fortunes are similarly bleak, with 13 matches without victory in the last 16 at Millerntor. Furthermore, 80% of their last 15 home league games have failed to bring three points.</p>\n<p>HSV’s struggles on the road are clear: in their past 13 away games, they've failed to win 85% of the time. Recent draws dominate their results, including three in both all competitions and Bundesliga across their last six matches, but converting these into wins has proven elusive. In the league, they have avoided defeat in only two of their last eleven matches.</p>\n<p>Taking into account the most recent three matchdays and existing injuries, the following are the most probable starting lineups.</p>\n<p><strong>St Pauli</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Nikola Vasilj</p>\n<p>Defenders: Karol Mets, Hauke Wahl, Adam Dzwigala</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Eric Smith, James Sands, Arkadiusz Pyrka, Louis Oppie</p>\n<p>Attackers: Mathias Pereira Lage, Joel Chima Fujita, Ricky-Jade Jones</p>\n<p><strong>Hamburger SV</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Daniel Heuer Fernandes</p>\n<p>Defenders: William Mikelbrencis, Daniel Elfadli, Luka Vuskovic, Miro Muheim</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Nicolás Capaldo, Nicolai Remberg, Bakery Jatta</p>\n<p>Attackers: Ransford Königsdörffer, Damion Downs, Fábio Vieira</p>\n<p>The historical edge at Millerntor and HSV’s away woes give St Pauli decent prospects in this contest. While both teams find it difficult to turn performances into wins, St Pauli’s record in these direct encounters provides an edge. The algorithmic prediction points toward a narrow 2-1 victory for St Pauli, with a 38% probability assigned to the home side claiming all three points.</p>\n<p>With both clubs in need of momentum, this fixture may well hinge on fine margins and capitalize on defensive lapses. If St Pauli can summon the spirit they have shown in past derbies at home, they have a pathway to an important result as the Bundesliga season moves forward.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">As Auxerre prepare to welcome Paris Saint-Germain to Stade de l'Abbé Deschamps on 23 January 2026, the odds appear stacked with the visitors. With the contrasting trajectories of both clubs this season, this fixture could prove decisive in defining the ambitions of each side for the remainder of the Ligue 1 campaign.</p>\n<p>Auxerre's season has been difficult, with the team currently occupying 17th place in Ligue 1. They have only managed three wins in eighteen matches and hold a negative goal difference of minus fourteen.</p>\n<p>Their recent performances paint a similar picture of struggle, having lost four matches in a row and failed to secure a win in 81% of their last 26 games in all competitions. Auxerre have particularly found points hard to come by at home, losing eight of their previous fifteen home fixtures in Ligue 1 and failing to win five out of the last six.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the home side have averaged just 1.33 goals per game across their last six outings, while conceding 1.83. Even when playing at home, the average shots on goal are 7.33, suggesting some attacking intent, but an average possession rate of just over 41% highlights a struggle for midfield control.</p>\n<p>Their head-to-head record with PSG tells a tale of difficulty as well. In the last five matches against the Paris side, Auxerre have lost four, including three defeats by a margin of two or more goals. PSG, on the other hand, travel to Burgundy with plenty of momentum. The reigning French champions sit second in the table, having won 68% of their last 40 matches in all competitions and taken victory in 13 of their 18 league games this term.</p>\n<p>PSG’s form away from home has been impressive, with the side remaining undefeated in 12 of their last 15 away fixtures in all competitions. They also boast 10 undefeated matches in their last 12 overall and have won nine of the last fifteen on the road, with 43% of their last 30 away wins coming by a two or more goal margin.</p>\n<p>Offensively, PSG are averaging 2.22 goals scored per league fixture, while only conceding 0.83. They are also controlling matches effectively, holding possession for nearly 66% of play on average over their last six games.</p>\n<p>Looking at probable lineups, Auxerre will be without defender Clément Akpa, who continues to miss out with a calf injury. Based on their most frequent recent selections and given the absentee, a likely start in a 4-3-3 would be:</p>\n<p><strong>Auxerre</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Donovan Léon<br/>Defenders: Sinaly Diomandé, Fredrik Oppegård, Lamine Sy, Marvin Senaya<br/>Midfielders: Kévin Danois, Rudy Matondo, Oussama El Azzouzi<br/>Attackers: Josué Casimir, Sékou Mara, Lasso Coulibaly</p>\n<p>PSG have a few absentees with João Neves, Kang-in Lee, Matvey Safonov, Quentin Ndjantou and Renato Marin all sidelined. Nonetheless, the squad’s depth suggests a starting 4-3-3 lineup of:</p>\n<p><strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Lucas Chevalier<br/>Defenders: Warren Zaïre-Emery, Willian Pacho, Ilya Zabarnyi, Nuno Mendes<br/>Midfielders: Fabián Ruiz, Vitinha, Senny Mayulu<br/>Attackers: Ousmane Dembélé, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Désiré Doué</p>\n<p>Auxerre’s ongoing struggles for points and their inability to keep clean sheets at home mean PSG come into this encounter as strong favourites. Not only have PSG remained undefeated in 90% of their last 20 Ligue 1 matches, but they are also capable of comprehensive victories, having won by at least two goals in 45% of those matches.</p>\n<p>Prediction models point toward another PSG win, estimating a 66% probability that they leave with three points. With both teams’ recent form trends and the strength in depth of the Parisians, Auxerre will need a significant performance to challenge.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">The fixture at Campo do Cevadeiro pitches two struggling sides head-to-head, as Casa Pia AC and AVS take the pitch with both teams eager to climb away from the lower reaches of the Liga Portugal table. Gaps have started to open between them and safety, adding extra relevance to this direct encounter.</p>\n<p>Whenever these sides have faced off, separating them has proven difficult. Their most recent meeting at this venue ended all square, with neither side able to clinch the decisive goal. Over their last three encounters across all competitions, two have finished as draws, underlining a pattern of even contests when Casa Pia and AVS go head-to-head.</p>\n<p>Courtney optimism has been in short supply among Casa Pia AC backers in recent weeks. They have won only one of their last six matches, drawing two and losing three, with an average of just 0.83 goals scored per match and conceding nearly twice that rate at 1.67. Their inability to finish chances continues to be costly, having failed to win in each of their last three matches in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Home form offers little relief for Casa Pia. Over their last three fixtures at Campo do Cevadeiro, they have gone winless (drawing two and losing once), while scoring at a rate of only 0.67 per match. The difficulties extend deeper: they have failed to win in 11 of their last 12 home games in all competitions, highlighting an ongoing struggle on their own patch.</p>\n<p>AVS have also endured a fraught campaign. They have managed just one win, one draw, and four losses in their last six league outings. Most concerning is their lack of offensive production, averaging only 0.5 goals per match, while shipping an alarming 2.17 on the defensive end. In their last three away fixtures, AVS have been outscored by eight goals to one and have failed to claim more than one point from nine available.</p>\n<p>Casa Pia AC sit 16th in the Liga Portugal standings after 18 matches, having won three, drawn five, and lost 10. Their 17 goals scored (0.94 per match) have not been enough to cover an often porous defense, which has allowed 35 goals (1.94 per match) for a negative goal difference of -18. Trend data further underscores persistent issues: Casa Pia have lost 20 of their last 40 matches in all competitions, while remaining winless in 10 of their last 12.</p>\n<p>AVS's campaign has been even tougher. Winless in the league, they occupy 18th place with four draws and 14 losses from 18 outings. Their defense has been particularly leaky, conceding 44 goals (2.44 per match), and scoring is a chronic issue at just 11 goals so far (0.61 per match), leading to a league-worst -33 goal difference. They have now failed to secure three points in 15 consecutive league fixtures and have lost 19 of their last 30 matches in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Casa Pia have drawn four of their last eight home fixtures, but the lack of victories dominates the narrative: 16 of their last 20 league matches have ended without a win. Defensive lapses are reflected in their record of losing by two or more goals in five of their last 13 games. Similarly, AVS's away woes are marked, with defeats in seven of their last 12 trips, and a winless stretch in nine of their last 11 on the road. They have lost by two or more goals in 65% of their last 20 away matches.</p>\n<p>Casa Pia AC:</p>\n<p><br/>Goalkeeper: Patrick Sequeira<br/>Defenders: Abdu Conté, José Fonte, David Sousa, André Geraldes<br/>Midfielders: Rafael Brito, Yassin Oukili, Jérémy Livolant, Gaizka Larrazabal, Renato Nhaga<br/>Attackers: Cassiano</p>\n<p>AVS:</p>\n<p><br/>Goalkeeper: Simão Verza Bertelli<br/>Defenders: Diogo Spencer, Leonardo Rivas, Carlos Ponck, Aderllan Leandro de Jesus Santos, Cristian David Castro Devenish<br/>Midfielders: Pedro Lima Barros, Babatunde Jimoh Akinsola, Jaume Grau Ciscar<br/>Attackers: Tomané</p>\n<p>With both teams struggling for confidence and cutting a similar figure in their lack of offensive spark, expectations point toward a low-scoring contest. AVS have failed to win in 15 straight league matches, while Casa Pia have not emerged victorious in 10 of their last 12. The algorithm projection signals a likely draw, with a 44% probability for a 1-1 outcome and fewer than three goals anticipated.</p>\n<p>This fixture appears poised to add another chapter to the balanced head-to-head record, unless one side can unexpectedly find a new attacking gear.</p>",
