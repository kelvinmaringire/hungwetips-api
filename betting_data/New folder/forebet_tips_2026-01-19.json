    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Both Brighton and Bournemouth come into their Premier League clash at the American Express Stadium locked in the mid-table, searching for consistency as they approach the twilight of January. While Brighton have made their home a tough fortress, Bournemouth face the challenge with a misfiring away record. The stakes are subtly high as neither side can afford to lose ground in a congested league table.</p>\n<p>Brighton's recent performances at home have made the seaside venue a difficult place for visitors. Across their last 12 home matches in all competitions, they've remained undefeated 92% of the time, which translates to losing just once in that run. Looking more specifically at their encounters with Bournemouth in the same setting, Brighton have taken victory in 4 of the last 5, including two occasions where they won by two or more goals, demonstrating a definitive edge when the Cherries arrive.</p>\n<p>However, while their overall home numbers are strong, Brighton have been navigating a tricky patch in all matches, winless in seven of their last eight. Their last six outings show just a single victory, supplemented by three draws and two losses, with an average of only 1 goal scored per game and conceding just slightly above that at 1.17. Despite this lean spell, their defense has shored up at the Amex – just 0.33 goals conceded on average in the last three home games and no defeats in those matches, picking up one win and two draws.</p>\n<p>Possession remains a strong suit for Fabian Hürzeler’s side, averaging 61.33% at home recently and over half throughout the season, suggesting they will once again look to dominate the ball. That said, converting control into goals will be essential if Brighton are to capitalize on their statistical supremacy at home.</p>\n<p>Bournemouth, under Andoni Iraola, occupy 15th in the league and have struggled to string together positive away results. Winless in 10 of their last 12 matches on the road and losing 50% of those, they've also fallen by two or more goals in 42% of such encounters. Their defensive record away is particularly concerning, with 3.33 goals shipped on average per game in their recent trio of away fixtures.</p>\n<p>The Cherries, though, are not short of attacking intent. They average 2.17 goals scored across their last six matches and 2.33 on the road in the same period, offsetting some shortcomings at the back. Their capacity to carve out chances is reflected in an average of 5.5 shots on target per match from their preceding six fixtures, a clear improvement from earlier in the campaign.</p>\n<p>Bournemouth's approach often yields open contests, as half of their last ten fixtures finished all square. However, with 12 matches winless in their last 15 across all venues, securing three points at the Amex will hinge on tightening defensive lapses while maintaining their output in attack.</p>\n<p>Looking at the probable lineups, both teams appear set to continue with familiar XIs. Brighton’s starting 11 is likely to feature the ever-reliable Bart Verbruggen in goal. The back four could line up with Lewis Dunk, Jan Paul van Hecke, Maxim De Cuyper and Joël Veltman. In midfield, Yasin Ayari, Diego Gómez, Ferdi Kadıoğlu, Kaoru Mitoma and James Milner likely offer balance and creativity, supporting attacker Danny Welbeck in a 4-2-3-1 formation.</p>\n<p>Probable Brighton Lineup:<br/>Goalkeeper: Bart Verbruggen<br/>Defenders: Lewis Dunk, Jan Paul van Hecke, Maxim De Cuyper, Joël Veltman<br/>Midfielders: Yasin Ayari, Diego Gómez, Ferdi Kadıoğlu, Kaoru Mitoma, James Milner<br/>Attacker: Danny Welbeck</p>\n<p>Bournemouth's consistent recent selections indicate Djordje Petrovic between the posts, shielded by Adrien Truffert, Marcos Senesi, Álex Jiménez, and James Hill. With Semenyo at City and Kluivert injured, the Cherries' midfield could see Marcus Tavernier, Alex Scott, David Brooks, Amine Adli, and Lewis Cook, just behind Evanilson leading the line, again likely in a 4-2-3-1.</p>\n<p>Probable Bournemouth Lineup:<br/>Goalkeeper: Djordje Petrovic<br/>Defenders: Adrien Truffert, Marcos Senesi, Álex Jiménez, James Hill<br/>Midfielders: Marcus Tavernier, Alex Scott, David Brooks, Amine Adli, Lewis Cook<br/>Attacker: Evanilson</p>\n<p>The data suggests two sides set up to challenge each other in midfield, but with neither boasting momentum, the margins remain slim. Forebet’s algorithm tips a draw as the most probable outcome, giving it a 43% chance, and a scoring stalemate such as 2-2 hardly seems out of reach given both teams' recent records.</p>\n<p>With Brighton boasting strong home numbers, particularly defensively, while Bournemouth carry more threat in attack but leak goals on the road, another closely-fought contest seems in prospect as statistical indicators point to honors being shared once more.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">As Elche prepare to host Sevilla at the Estadio Manuel Martínez Valero, both squads are aiming to shift their narratives in La Liga. While Elche seek to climb into the league's upper echelons, Sevilla look to reverse a disappointing run that has left them glancing over their shoulders at the relegation scrap.</p>\n<p>Elche enter this fixture having posted three victories, one draw, and two defeats in their last six matches. Their average of 1.83 goals scored per game has been bolstered by their recent home performances, where they've netted 2.67 times on average across the last three outings. Defensively, they've been sturdy, conceding just once per game in that span. Their possession statistics also stand out, having controlled an average 60.67% at home.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Sevilla's recent form has been concerning. Just one win, one draw, and four losses in their last six matches tells its own story. The lack of attacking thrust is evident, with Sevilla managing only 0.83 goals per game in this stretch, while also conceding 1.33. Their away displays bring little relief either, losing twice and drawing once in their last three league games on the road.</p>\n<p>Head to head, Elche and Sevilla have shared closely contested battles in their last three meetings. Elche have failed to secure a win, recording two draws and one loss against Sevilla. While the margins have been slim, the recent record indicates Sevilla have edged these encounters, albeit narrowly.</p>\n<p>After 19 rounds, Elche sit ninth in the standings with five victories, eight draws, and six defeats. They've scored 25 and conceded 24, maintaining a positive goal difference. Sevilla, meanwhile, occupy fourteenth place with six wins, two draws, and eleven losses from nineteen matches. Their defensive issues are underlined by 30 goals conceded — over 1.5 per match — which has undercut their campaign, even as they match Elche's output going forward.</p>\n<p>Elche's home resilience has served them well. Undefeated in 13 of their last 15 home matches across all competitions, and unbeaten in 18 of their last 20 home contests specifically in La Liga, they have formed a habit of making their stadium a challenging ground for visitors. Clean sheets feature prominently, with six in their last twelve home outings.</p>\n<p>Sevilla's recent downturn can hardly be overlooked. The team have failed to win in 5 of their last 6 outings and have lost 4 in a row in all competitions. This negative run away from their own turf is pronounced: Sevilla have come up short in 9 of their last 15 away fixtures, conceding multiple goals in over a third of their recent league games on the road.</p>\n<p>Elche</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Iñaki Peña</p>\n<p>Defenders: Pedro Bigas, Víctor Chust, David Affengruber</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Marc Aguado, Germán Valera, Aleix Febas, Álvaro Núñez, John Donald</p>\n<p>Attackers: Álvaro Rodríguez, Grady Diangana</p>\n<p>Sevilla</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Odysseas Vlachodimos</p>\n<p>Defenders: José Ángel Carmona, Nemanja Gudelj, Kike Salas</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Juanlu Sánchez, Lucien Agoumé, Batista Mendy, Djibril Sow, Oso</p>\n<p>Attackers: Alexis Sánchez, Peque Fernández</p>\n<p>The balance of recent form and squad availability leans toward Elche. Their solid home record and Sevilla's winless struggles suggest the hosts are poised to take advantage. The probability model gives Elche a 40% edge to win, hinting at a likely but close victory — with 2-1 the most probable scoreline. Sevilla's defensive issues and long absentee list may prove decisive in tilting this match in favor of the hosts at the Manuel Martínez Valero.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two teams aiming to break winless runs meet at Stadio Giovanni Zini as Cremonese host Verona in Serie A. With both sides hoping to reverse disappointing recent fortunes, defensive discipline could prove decisive in this closely-matched battle.</p>\n<p>This fixture presents a fascinating meeting between sides whose recent performances have seen more frustrations than celebrations. Cremonese arrive in 13th place after 20 games, recording 5 wins, 7 draws, and 8 losses. Their goal tally stands at 20 while conceding 28. Verona, meanwhile, sit at the foot of the table in 20th, with just 2 wins to their name, 7 draws, and 11 losses, giving up 34 goals while netting 17.</p>\n<p>Looking at the last two meetings at Giovanni Zini, Cremonese and Verona have drawn both contests, with neither side able to break the deadlock. This sets the precedent for another tight encounter, especially with both needing points to improve their respective positions.</p>\n<p>Cremonese’s recent form under Davide Nicola has brought little joy. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions, they haven’t won, taking just 2 draws and suffering 4 defeats. Offensive production has been limited, with only 0.33 goals scored per game and an average of 2.67 shots on target. They have also struggled without the ball, averaging 44.33% possession during this stretch.</p>\n<p>However, Cremonese’s home numbers hint at a more resilient side when on familiar turf. Across their last three home matches, they have won once, drawn once, and lost once. The improvements in front of goal are clear, with a scoring average climbing to 1.33 per game, matched by an equal number conceded. Their shots on goal have increased to 3.67, and possession ticks up to 47%.</p>\n<p>In terms of long-term home trends, Cremonese have been hard to break down, suffering defeat in just 5 of their last 25 home matches in all competitions. Despite this, they remain winless in 9 of their last 11 home outings, showing that while they are tough to beat, finding that extra edge to secure three points remains elusive.</p>\n<p>Verona come into this game similarly short of form. Paolo Zanetti’s side has not secured a win in any of their last five outings, and their away record is equally concerning. Over their last 12 away matches in all competitions, they have not picked up a win in 83% of them. In their most recent six matches, they have collected just one victory, one draw, and suffered four losses, conceding an average of 2.17 per game while scoring just once per match. Possession numbers are even lower than their opponents, averaging 39.17%.</p>\n<p>Looking at Verona’s last three away games, they hardly offer more encouragement: one win, one draw, and one loss, but with a defense giving up 2 goals on average per game. Over larger sample sizes, Verona have lost 55% of their last 20 matches, and 50% of their last 14 on the road. They have also suffered defeat by two or more goals in 40% of their last ten away fixtures, underscoring defensive vulnerabilities that Cremonese will be eager to exploit.</p>\n<p>Team selection will be influenced by absentees for both sides. Cremonese will need to shuffle their midfield, with Giuseppe Pezzella (suspended), Martín Payero (illness), and long-term absentee Warren Bondo all unavailable. Verona have to cope without Fallou Cham, Tomas Suslov, Rafik Belghali, Martin Frese, and Armel Bella-Kotchap, which may see them lean on a set of consistent recent starters.</p>\n<p><strong>Cremonese probable starting XI:</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Emil Audero</p>\n<p>Defenders: Federico Baschirotto, Matteo Bianchetti, Filippo Terracciano</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Tommaso Barbieri, Romano Floriani Mussolini, Dennis Johnsen, Jari Vandeputte, Alberto Grassi</p>\n<p>Attackers: Jamie Vardy, Federico Bonazzoli</p>\n<p><strong>Verona probable starting XI:</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Lorenzo Montipò</p>\n<p>Defenders: Nicolás Valentini, Unai Núñez, Victor Nelsson</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Moatasem Al-Musrati, Domagoj Bradarić, Antoine Bernede, Cheikh Niasse, Roberto Gagliardini</p>\n<p>Attackers: Gift Orban, Amin Sarr</p>\n<p>When it comes to predictions, both teams’ attacking challenges suggest goals may be in short supply. The algorithm gives Cremonese a 43% chance of victory, with a most probable scoreline of 2-0 and a strong indication that under 2.5 goals will be scored. With both outfits struggling to find wins and goals in recent matches, defenses may once again come out on top.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Estádio José Gomes is the stage for a Liga Portugal clash featuring Estrela Amadora and GD Estoril, two sides separated by just a handful of points in the table. With both teams showing flashes of form and frailty this season, their previous encounters and ongoing trends suggest a contest where neither side will give much away.</p>\n<p>Looking at their last two meetings in Amadora, the record is even, with each team having claimed a victory at Estrela’s ground. Over a broader span, the head-to-head remains finely poised, keeping analysts guessing which way this fixture might tip.</p>\n<p>Estrela Amadora’s recent form, in both the league and across all competitions, is a mix of resilience and inconsistency. Over their last six matches, they’ve recorded two wins, two draws, and two defeats, finding the net at an average of 1.67 goals a game, but also conceding 2.17 per match. There is, however, a growing steadiness at home where they remain undefeated in five of their last six league matches, drawing four of the past eight at home in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Zooming in on their home form specifically, Estrela have won one and drawn two of the previous three, scoring an average of two goals while conceding 1.33. Their shot and possession statistics surge significantly when playing at Estádio José Gomes, with 16 total shots and 51.33% possession across those three games — a notable jump compared to their season averages.</p>\n<p>Despite that, Estrela Amadora have struggled to convert home advantage into consistent runs. Over their last ten home matches, they have been winless in eight and have lost exactly half of their most recent 18 home fixtures. Over the larger sample of their last 36 Liga Portugal matches, they've managed just seven wins, underlining a struggle to string together victories.</p>\n<p>GD Estoril, coached by Ian Cathro, present a slightly more attacking profile but possess similar defensive vulnerabilities. In their last six, Estoril have picked up two wins but fallen three times, averaging 1.5 goals scored and 2 conceded. Their away form is a concern, as they have lost half of their previous 12 matches on the road and have been winless in 80% of the last ten away fixtures.</p>\n<p>Comparing their league positions, Estoril sit 9th with 17 games producing five wins, five draws and seven defeats. Their games tend to be open, with 28 goals for and 29 against. Estrela are just three places behind in 12th, also after 17 matches, with seven draws highlighting their inability to turn tight matches into full points.</p>\n<p>Away from the bare statistics, the tactical makeup of both teams hints at a closely contested encounter. Estrela Amadora are expected to continue with their favored 4-2-3-1 formation. Taking into account the lineups from the last three matches, and with no suspended or injured players reported, the starting eleven appears settled:</p>\n<p><strong>Estrela Amadora</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Renan Ribeiro</p>\n<p>Defenders: Bernardo Schappo, Jefferson Encada, Luan Patrick, Otavio Manoel Galdino Fernandes</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Paulo Moreira, Oumar Ngom, Jovane Cabral, Alex Sola, Abraham Marcus</p>\n<p>Attackers: Kikas</p>\n<p>Estoril, meanwhile, have predominantly used variations of a 4-4-2 and a 4-2-3-1 in recent matches. Their most likely lineup, based on regular starters, reads:</p>\n<p><strong>GD Estoril</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Joel Robles</p>\n<p>Defenders: Ricard Sánchez, Pedro Amaral, Felix Bacher, Kévin Boma</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Jandro Orellana, Jordan Holsgrove, João Carvalho, Yanis Begraoui, Rafik Guitane</p>\n<p>Attackers: Alejandro Marqués</p>\n<p>Digging further into the trends, Estrela's inability to finish off visitors is matched by Estoril’s ongoing troubles away from home, as they've lost by two or more goals in three of their last seven road outings. However, Estrela's defense has also been breached by such margins in two of their last three encounters with Estoril.</p>\n<p>All told, despite periods of positive play, both squads have found it hard to exert sustained dominance. With their league records so tight and both enjoying some stability in selections, the statistics support the prediction of parity.</p>\n<p>The most probable outcome points to a draw, with each team holding a 35% probability to share the spoils — a result which matches the balanced feel suggested by the numbers and recent performances.</p>",
