    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">FA Cup ties have a way of sharpening contrasts, and this one sets a front-foot Salford City against a Swindon Town side that has kept matches tight and tidy. Styles, streaks and the weight of the competition collide, setting the stage for a contest that feels balanced on detail rather than noise.</p>\n<p>Salford arrive with confidence built on substance. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions, they have 4 wins, 2 draws and 0 losses, averaging 1.83 goals scored and 1 conceded. At home over their last 3, the output climbs to 18.67 total shots and 7 on target per match with 55.33% possession, suggesting a side that pushes the tempo and creates repeat shooting positions.</p>\n<p>Swindon’s recent profile differs. Over their last 6 in all competitions they own 4 wins and 2 losses, with just 0.33 goals conceded on average, and 51.67% possession. The shot volume is calmer at 11.5 attempts and 3.5 on target per match, but the defensive efficiency stands out and has carried them through tight encounters.</p>\n<p>Broad trend lines favor Salford’s consistency. They have won 17 of their last 30 in all competitions and have not been defeated in 8 of their last 10. At home, they have kept clean sheets in 42% of their last 12 and avoided defeat in 13 of their last 15, a platform that typically underpins cup progress.</p>\n<p>FA Cup specific markers also lean their way. Salford have 3 wins across their last 6 ties in this competition, have not been defeated in 6 of their last 7 FA Cup matches, and have taken 4 wins across their last 8 at home in the FA Cup while staying unbeaten in 5 of their last 6 FA Cup home ties. Those numbers speak to a team that handles knockout rhythm at their ground.</p>\n<p>Swindon counter with strong away habits in all competitions: 7 wins in their last 12 away matches, clean sheets in 42% of those 12, and they have not been defeated in 6 of their last 7 away. Five wins by 2 or more across their last 12 away matches adds proof of punch when they get the first goal.</p>\n<p>The question is how that travels into the FA Cup, where Swindon’s longer-range record is less forgiving. They have drawn 3 of their last 6 FA Cup matches, are winless in 6 of their last 7 in the competition, and have lost 50% of their last 18 FA Cup ties. In that same 7-match FA Cup sample, 43% of their defeats were by 2 or more goals, an edge Salford will try to exploit if they gain control early.</p>\n<p>Head-to-head at this venue has been balanced with a slight Swindon lean: across the last 6 Salford home meetings with Swindon, Salford have 2 wins, 1 draw and 3 losses. More broadly, the fixture has had stalemate tendencies too, with 3 draws in the last 5 meetings between the sides in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Karl Robinson’s approach with Salford has recently settled into a back three with energetic wide outlets and two forwards. With Adebola Oluwo, Josh Austerfield and Oliver Turton sidelined, the shape should still encourage Kelly N’Mai and Rosaire Longelo to drive play while Matt Butcher links phases and the front pair looks to pin Swindon’s center-backs.</p>\n<p>Ian Holloway has rotated between a back three and a back four, but without Ryan Tafazolli a 4-2-3-1 looks likely, using Gavin Kilkenny and Darren Oldaker to screen and build. Tom Nichols, Paul Glatzel and Joel McGregor can combine between the lines, and Billy Bodin offers end product if Swindon’s counters break cleanly.</p>\n<p>Salford City probable lineup</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Matthew Young</p>\n<p>Defenders: Brandon Cooper, Luke Garbutt, Kevin Berkoe</p>\n<p>Midfielders: J. Grant, Kelly N’Mai, Matt Butcher, Kallum Cesay, Rosaire Longelo</p>\n<p>Attackers: Daniel Udoh, Cole Stockton</p>\n<p>Swindon Town probable lineup</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Connor Ripley</p>\n<p>Defenders: Will Wright, Jamie Knight-Lebel, Filozofe Mabete, Finley Munroe</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Gavin Kilkenny, Darren Oldaker, Tom Nichols, Paul Glatzel, Joel McGregor</p>\n<p>Attackers: Billy Bodin</p>\n<p>The pattern points to a front-foot home side against a compact visitor, and the numbers also lean toward goals. With Salford’s chance creation, Swindon’s knack for keeping games narrow, and a head-to-head that has produced its share of stalemates, a score draw holds value. Prediction: Draw at 45% with a leaning toward 2-2 and over 2.5 goals.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two teams carrying very different rhythms cross paths, one leaning on possession and chance creation, the other searching for efficiency and a way to stop the slide. It sets up a contrast in styles that should hinge on midfield control and box quality.</p>\n<p>Kairat arrive with a last six run of 1 win, 2 draws and 3 losses in all competitions, averaging 0.83 goals scored and 1.17 conceded. The shot profile is modest at 11.33 attempts and 4 on target per match with 49.83% possession, underlining a side that struggles to impose tempo.</p>\n<p>At home over their last three, Kairat are 0 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss, scoring 0.33 and conceding 0.67 per match. The possession mark rises to 55%, but end product remains an issue.</p>\n<p>Club Brugge’s last six in all competitions is 3 wins and 3 losses, with 2.33 goals scored and 2.17 conceded. They average 15 shots and 6 on target with 58.17% possession, numbers that point to territory and chance creation with a willingness to commit bodies forward.</p>\n<p>Kairat’s immediate sequence is harsh. They have lost 3 in a row in all competitions and are winless in 5 of their last 6. Despite that, their home resilience has flashed before, which keeps this matchup from being one way.</p>\n<p>Brugge have swung between strong attacking spells and defensive lapses. The visitors generate volume and speed through wide areas, but they have also allowed games to become stretched, which has fed into their mixed results line.</p>\n<p>In the Champions League, Kairat sit 36th at 0 wins, 1 draw and 5 losses, with 4 goals for and 15 against. That is 0.67 scored and 2.5 conceded per game with a goal difference of minus 11. Brugge are 31st at 1 win, 1 draw and 4 losses, 8 goals for and 16 against, which is 1.33 scored and 2.67 conceded per game with a goal difference of minus 8.</p>\n<p>Kairat’s league stage returns reflect difficulty coping with sustained pressure. Brugge’s record is also negative, yet their attacking average suggests they arrive with the more active threat between the lines.</p>\n<p>Kairat’s broader home body of work is far better than their current league stage snapshot. They are undefeated in 16 of their last 20 home matches in all competitions and have won 60% of those, which is 12 of 20. In the Champions League, they have kept clean sheets in 6 of their last 9 home matches, and they have won 5 of those 9.</p>\n<p>The warning signs are clear too. Kairat are winless in 12 of their last 15 Champions League matches and have lost 7 of their last 12 in the competition. Brugge, meanwhile, have won 6 of their last 12 away matches in all competitions but have also lost 7 of their last 14 away. In the Champions League, they have won 7 of their last 14, yet are winless in 5 of their last 6, and have lost by 2 or more goals in 6 of their last 15.</p>\n<p>Expect Kairat to keep their 4-2-3-1 shape compact, rely on structured possession phases, and aim to slow transitions. Brugge tend to dominate the ball, push full backs high, and funnel attacks through Hans Vanaken between the lines with runners beyond the last shoulder.</p>\n<p>Kairat Almaty</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Temirlan Anarbekov</p>\n<p>Defenders: Erkin Tapalov; Egor Sorokin; Aleksandr Shirobokov; Luís Mata</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Damir Kasabulat; Dan Glazer; Jorginho; Valeriy Gromyko; Dastan Satpaev</p>\n<p>Attackers: Edmilson</p>\n<p>Unavailable: João Paulo and Élder Santana.</p>\n<p>Club Brugge</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Dani van den Heuvel</p>\n<p>Defenders: Kyriani Sabbe; Brandon Mechele; Joel Ordóñez; Joaquin Seys</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Aleksandar Stanković; Hugo Vetlesen; Hans Vanaken; Christos Tzolis; Carlos Forbs</p>\n<p>Attackers: Romeo Vermant</p>\n<p>Unavailable: Simon Mignolet and Lynnt Audoor.</p>\n<p>With Brugge’s superior shot volume and Kairat’s current league stage numbers, the visitors carry the edge. The Forebet model points to Over 2.5 goals and a most likely score of 1-2, with a Brugge win at 39% probability. Prediction: Club Brugge to win 1-2.</p>",
