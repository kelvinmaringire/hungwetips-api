    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Sunderland prepare for a fresh Premier League encounter at the Stadium of Light, squaring off against a Burnley side desperate to shift momentum and climb away from danger. Both teams have points to prove as the season edges deeper into 2026, and the statistics around this match set the stage for an intriguing tactical contest.</p>\n<p>These teams have a recent history marked by close encounters. Looking back at the last four direct meetings on Sunderland's home ground, it's Sunderland with a marginal advantage: one win, two draws, and Burnley stealing a solitary victory. This trend suggests matches between these sides at the Stadium of Light rarely tilt heavily either way.</p>\n<p>For Sunderland, home stability remains a key talking point. Across their last 12 home fixtures in all competitions, they have maintained an undefeated record in 100% of those games. Digging further, they have avoided defeat in 83% of their last 30 home league matches, establishing the venue as a tough place for visitors.</p>\n<p>Performance figures for Sunderland show mixed signals. Over the last six matches, they have managed just one win alongside three draws and two defeats. They are netting 0.83 goals on average per game and conceding 1.5, indicating a need for efficiency at both ends. Their shooting numbers stay modest, with 11.5 attempts per match and a possession share just below 50%.</p>\n<p>Recent home form, though, is more encouraging for Régis Le Bris's team. The last three matches at the Stadium of Light have brought one win and two draws, with just 0.67 goals conceded on average. Sunderland also claim a 50% win rate across their last 12 home Premier League matches, further reinforcing their home credentials.</p>\n<p>Burnley, sitting in 19th place, are finding away matches particularly tough this campaign. Their most recent six games have produced just one win, three draws, and two defeats, but more worryingly, they haven’t claimed victory in 18 of their last 20 matches in all competitions. Their defensive frailty is apparent, conceding 1.91 goals per match across the league while scoring 1.09.</p>\n<p>Draws feature prominently for Burnley, both in the league and all competitions, standing at 50% of their last 10 matches. Their away records confirm their struggles: 83% of the last 12 away games have failed to bring a win. Clean sheets are hard to find too, with just 43% of their last 30 away games finishing without conceding. While four-match undefeated streaks are positive, a turnaround remains essential for survival hopes.</p>\n<p>When reviewing team news, Sunderland have to contend without Granit Xhaka (ankle injury) and Aji Alese (broken leg). Burnley are missing Mike Tresor, Josh Cullen, and Zeki Amdouni, all with significant injury layoffs, and none will feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunderland:</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Robin Roefs</p>\n<p>Defenders: Dan Ballard, Omar Alderete, Reinildo Mandava, Nordi Mukiele</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Chris Rigg, Enzo Le Fée, Trai Hume, Romaine Mundle</p>\n<p>Attackers: Brian Brobbey, Eliezer Mayenda</p>\n<p>Sunderland are likely to line up in their familiar 4-2-3-1, with Roefs in goal and Ballard anchoring the defense. Rigg takes the place of the sidelined Xhaka in midfield. Mundle and Hume on the flanks provide fresh legs alongside the creative Le Fée, while Brobbey and Mayenda offer threat up front.</p>\n<p><strong>Burnley:</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Martin Dúbravka</p>\n<p>Defenders: Maxime Estève, Axel Tuanzebe, Bashir Humphreys</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Kyle Walker, Lesley Ugochukwu, Florentino, Lucas Pires</p>\n<p>Attackers: Marcus Edwards, Jaidon Anthony, Armando Broja</p>\n<p>Scott Parker’s Burnley are likely to stick to their recent 3-4-2-1 setup. Dúbravka marshals the team from the back, with Tuanzebe and Estève in central defense. Without Cullen and Amdouni, Ugochukwu partners Florentino in midfield, while the attacking trident of Edwards, Anthony, and Broja will carry Burnley’s attacking hopes.</p>\n<p>Sunderland’s robust home record stands in sharp contrast to Burnley’s travel woes, and based on current form and squad availability, the metrics favor the hosts. The predictive model hands Sunderland a 48% probability of victory, leaning towards a possible 2-0 outcome.</p>\n<p>With Sunderland so rarely beaten at home and Burnley still searching for answers on their travels, every stat points to a tactical battle where the home side hold the edge.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">When Real Mallorca welcome Sevilla to Estadi Mallorca Son Moix on February 2, the numbers suggest a closely contested encounter. Both teams have found consistency tough to come by, and with recent head-to-heads often ending in draws or narrow victories, this clash could once again go down to the wire.</p>\n<p>Looking back at their last 10 meetings in all competitions, Real Mallorca have managed just 2 wins against Sevilla, with 4 matches ending level and Sevilla claiming 4 victories. The most striking feature is how tightly these encounters have been contested, with points usually being shared or either side scraping narrow wins.</p>\n<p>For Real Mallorca, their most recent run of form in La Liga leaves much to be desired. Over their last 6 matches, they have only won once, drawn once, and lost 4, averaging just 1 goal per game while conceding nearly twice as many at 1.83. Shots on target have been low as well, with just over 3 per game, and average possession coming in at 45.33%.</p>\n<p>However, the story brightens a bit when focusing on Mallorca's home record. Across their last 3 matches at Estadi Mallorca Son Moix, they've managed 2 victories and 1 defeat, with goals per game improving to 2.33 scored and 1.67 conceded. Their attacking sharpness increases at home, taking an average of 13.67 total shots and over 6 on goal per match, alongside improved possession statistics.</p>\n<p>This resilience is confirmed within longer trends too: Mallorca have gone undefeated in 8 of their last 10 home matches in La Liga, a sequence spanning both wins and draws. While the team has struggled overall this season and currently sits 18th in the table with a negative goal difference of -9, that home form provides much-needed encouragement.</p>\n<p>Sevilla's recent results mirror Mallorca in their struggles. In their last 6 matches, they have also managed just a single win and draw, losing 4. Their attacking output has been even more concerning, scoring just 0.67 goals per match, though they take more shots on average—13.33 per match with 5.33 on target. Their average possession over those games stands at a healthy 53%, indicating more control of the ball but not always converting that into goals.</p>\n<p>When looking specifically at Sevilla's away performances, things become even less convincing. Over their last 7 away matches in all competitions, they have been winless in 86% of them, showing a trend of struggling on their travels. Moreover, overall in their last 20 away games, they’ve lost 55% of the time.</p>\n<p>In terms of La Liga season performance, Sevilla currently occupy 12th place with 7 wins, 3 draws, and 11 losses. While their defensive struggles are similar to Mallorca’s, conceding an average of 1.57 goals per match, Sevilla do have a slightly better scoring rate at 1.33 per game. Yet, issues converting possession and shots into goals have hampered their upward progress.</p>\n<p>Sidelined players could influence both starting elevens. Real Mallorca will miss Manu Morlanes and Iván Cuéllar (goalkeeper) due to injury and suspension, respectively. Sevilla's list is much longer, with Isaac Romero, Joan Jordán, Nemanja Gudelj, Marcão, Alfon González, Rubén Vargas, Tanguy Nianzou, César Azpilicueta, and Adnan Januzaj all unavailable due to suspensions and injuries.</p>\n<p><strong>Probable Lineups:</strong></p>\n<p>Real Mallorca</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Leo Román</p>\n<p>Defenders: Johan Mojica, Martin Valjent, Marash Kumbulla, Pablo Maffeo</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Omar Mascarell, Samú Costa, Sergi Darder, Antonio Sánchez</p>\n<p>Attackers: Vedat Muriqi, Jan Virgili</p>\n<p>Sevilla</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Odysseas Vlachodimos</p>\n<p>Defenders: José Ángel Carmona, Kike Salas, Fábio Cardoso</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Juanlu Sánchez, Batista Mendy, Djibril Sow, Gabriel Suazo, Lucien Agoumé</p>\n<p>Attackers: Akor Adams, Peque Fernández</p>\n<p>Given the recent head-to-head history, host resilience at home, and away difficulties experienced by Sevilla, both teams have reasons for optimism and concern. The Forebet algorithm points to a draw as the most probable result, with around 35% probability for a stalemate, underscoring just how close this battle is on paper.</p>\n<p>While Mallorca need the points more urgently in their bid to escape the relegation zone, Sevilla will hope their squad depth can compensate for the absentees. Small details and perhaps an individual moment of quality could tip a balanced fixture whose outcome is tough to call based on the numbers.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">With Roma surging up the Serie A standings and Udinese eager to steady their campaign, the fixture at Dacia Arena is set to offer plenty of intrigue. Head-to-head trends, recent form data, and some key squad absences add further layers to this clash between mid-table resilience and top-four ambition.</p>\n<p>When these two sides met earlier in the season, Roma secured a confident 2-0 home win. The match statistics behind the result told the story of Roma’s dominance. The capital club fired 13 shots to Udinese’s 10, each landing four efforts on target, but Roma’s clinical edge made the difference. They also bossed possession at 58% and engineered 53 dangerous attacks to Udinese’s 28.</p>\n<p>Goals from Lorenzo Pellegrini, converting a penalty on 42 minutes, and Zeki Çelik, scoring in the 61st, showcased Roma’s efficiency in key moments. Udinese, despite creating some chances, couldn’t make their efforts count. The numbers reiterate Roma’s comfort with dictating play against this opponent.</p>\n<p>Looking at Udinese over the last six, inconsistency has crept in with two wins, two draws, and two defeats. They’ve been finding the net at a rate of 1.33 per match while conceding 1.17, and shots on target have averaged just three—a stat that highlights issues in converting attacks into clear-cut chances.</p>\n<p>Roma, by contrast, have strung together a run of four wins, a draw, and just one loss across their last six fixtures. Scoring at 1.83 per game and conceding only 0.67 shows a solid balance at both ends of the pitch, while 4.83 shots on target per game underlines their forward threat. Their ball possession numbers average a commanding 57.67% in that span.</p>\n<p>After 22 rounds, Udinese are 10th with eight wins, five draws, and nine defeats. Their negative goal difference (25 scored, 34 conceded) stems from defensive frailties, although the gap isn’t insurmountable when compared to the teams around them.</p>\n<p>Roma’s campaign paints a contrasting picture. Seated comfortably in fourth, they have collected 14 victories, one draw, and tasted defeat seven times. Their +14 goal differential is built on the back of the division’s second tightest defense, conceding only 13. Roma’s average of 1.23 goals scored per game reflects a disciplined approach with sparks of attacking quality.</p>\n<p>Udinese have found home comforts hard to come by of late. They are winless in five of their last six on their own turf and have lost 70% of their last ten home matches against Roma. Broader trends reveal that Udinese’s possession averages hover below 45% and they concede over 1.5 goals per game across the league campaign.</p>\n<p>Roma’s recent runs are impressive—the Giallorossi have avoided defeat in five of their last six outings and marked up seven wins in their previous twelve Serie A fixtures. Winning by two or more goals in 38% of their last 26, and keeping 13 clean sheets in 32 away trips shows a squad comfortable taking command on the road. They are undefeated in 83% of their last six league matches and have not lost in 17 of their last 20 home league fixtures.</p>\n<p><strong>Udinese</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Maduka Okoye</p>\n<p>Defenders: Oumar Solet, Thomas Kristensen, Christian Kabasele, Nicolò Bertola</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Alessandro Zanoli, Jesper Karlström, Jordan Zemura, Lennon Miller</p>\n<p>Attackers: Jurgen Ekkelenkamp, Keinan Davis</p>\n<p><strong>Roma</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Mile Svilar</p>\n<p>Defenders: Gianluca Mancini, Evan Ndicka, Daniele Ghilardi</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Bryan Cristante, Wesley, Konstantinos Tsimikas, Zeki Çelik</p>\n<p>Attackers: Donyell Malen, Matías Soulé, Paulo Dybala</p>\n<p>The trends and the balance of data make Roma clear favorites to maintain their push near the summit. Roma’s superior form, particularly their recent resilience away and defensive solidity, stands in contrast to Udinese’s patchy results and struggles both at home and against this particular opponent historically.</p>\n<p>Significant absentees such as Pellegrini and El Shaarawy for Roma, plus Piotrowski for Udinese, are a blow but the depth of Roma’s squad has consistently covered gaps this season. The Forebet algorithm projects a 52% probability of a Roma victory, in line with both historical and current form. Udinese’s inability to impose themselves at home could prove costly once again.</p>\n<p>Roma’s tactical structure and individual quality should be enough to secure three points and reinforce their status as a top-four chasing side in Serie A.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">With the league campaign reaching a pivotal phase, Sporting Braga make the trip to Estádio Clube Desportivo das Aves to meet an AVS side languishing at the bottom of the Liga Portugal table. Both clubs enter this fixture with contrasting recent performances, setting the stage for a key showdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at their last three encounters, Sporting Braga have proven a tough challenge for AVS. Braga have emerged victorious twice and drawn once, leaving AVS still searching for a breakthrough win in this fixture. AVS have struggled to find the back of the net and contain Braga's attacking threats over this period, a trend that weighs on the host's confidence coming into this match.</p>\n<p>AVS's current run in the league has been troubling. In their last six matches, they've posted just a single win, coupled with two draws and three defeats. Offensively, the team has averaged only a goal per match while conceding over 1.6, figures that highlight a lack of cutting edge in attack and issues in defense.</p>\n<p>Their home record offers little respite; in AVS's last three games at Estádio Clube Desportivo das Aves, they've failed to win, drawing once and losing twice, managing a mere 0.67 goals per home match. Possession statistics show AVS often surrender control, averaging just 38% at home recently.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Sporting Braga are enjoying a more productive spell. Their last six games have seen them secure four wins, scoring at an average of two goals per match while conceding just 0.83. Braga's away displays have been robust, with high possession numbers and consistent attacking output. Braga's last three away fixtures feature a 61% possession average, emphasizing their control and fluidity in midfield.</p>\n<p>AVS remain at the foot of the standings, sitting 18th with 0 wins, 5 draws, and 14 defeats from 19 games. Their -33 goal difference underlines persistent defensive frailties, with 14 goals scored and 47 conceded at a rate of 2.47 per match.</p>\n<p>Sporting Braga, meanwhile, are positioned fourth. Nine wins, six draws, and four losses have them firmly in the hunt for European spots. With nearly two goals scored per match and just under one conceded, Braga have established a well-balanced squad capable at both ends of the pitch.</p>\n<p>AVS's main trends paint a clear picture of their struggles: they have been winless in 87% of their last 30 matches across all competitions, losing 60% of their last 20 games and conceding heavily. Particularly stark is their home winless ratio of 83% from their last 30 home matches, with an even higher percentage in league fixtures.</p>\n<p>Sporting Braga's trends are much more favourable. They've won 58% of their last 40 matches in all competitions and remained undefeated in 82% of their last 17. Their ability to secure results away from home is reflected in being undefeated in 80% of their last 20 away matches.</p>\n<p><strong>AVS</strong></p>\n<p><br/>Goalkeeper: Adriel<br/>Defenders: Diogo Spencer, Carlos Ponck, Cristian David Castro Devenish, Leonardo Rivas<br/>Midfielders: Pedro Lima Barros, Babatunde Jimoh Akinsola, Roni<br/>Attackers: Tomané, Babatunde Jimoh Akinsola, Guilherme Neiva Silva</p>\n<p>Given the absence of Óscar Perea, Lucas Moura Alviano, and Guillem Molina Gutiérrez, AVS are likely to opt for a four-man defense, utilizing players with recent lineup consistency. Christian Neiva Afonso and Gustavo Pinto Mendonça may be rotated based on fitness and tactical choice, but defensive solidity will be a priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Sporting Braga</strong></p>\n<p><br/>Goalkeeper: Lukas Hornicek<br/>Defenders: Víctor Gómez, Vítor Carvalho, Bright Arrey-Mbi<br/>Midfielders: Leonardo Lelo, João Moutinho, Mario Dorgeles, Gorby<br/>Attackers: Pau Víctor, Ricardo Horta, Fran Navarro</p>\n<p>Sporting Braga should line up in their familiar 3-4-3, with Sikou Niakaté and Gustaf Lagerbielke possible options in defense depending on final decisions. With Amine El Ouazzani and Sandro Vidigal sidelined, attacking duties will fall to Pau Víctor, Ricardo Horta, and Fran Navarro, all of whom have featured regularly.</p>\n<p>Taking all factors into account, Sporting Braga appear well placed to claim the points. AVS are winless in 87% of their last 30 matches in all competitions and haven't won in 92% of their last 12 home games in the league. Conversely, Braga remain undefeated in 24 of their last 30 league games and are on a three match winning streak.</p>\n<p>The statistical projection places Sporting Braga as favorites, with a 61% probability for an away victory. Given the hosts' form and Braga's attacking strengths, a 2-1 win for the visitors is a plausible scenario.</p>",
