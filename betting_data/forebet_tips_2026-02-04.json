    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">The path to Wembley narrows to a razor’s edge as Manchester City welcome Newcastle United for a semi-final that balances City’s ferocious home rhythm with Newcastle’s sturdy cup credentials. Form, history and personnel all tug in different directions, making the margins intriguing.</p>\n<p>Manchester City arrive with a mixed last six in all competitions at 3 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, but the headline is how those numbers change at home. Across their last three at home, City are perfect with 3 wins, averaging 4.67 goals scored and only 0.33 conceded, while also lifting their shot volume to 14 attempts per match and 6.33 on target with roughly 62% of the ball. Pep Guardiola’s side have also gone undefeated in their last 3 in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Newcastle’s broader picture is more uneven. Eddie Howe’s team are 1 win, 2 draws and 3 losses in their last six in all competitions, averaging 0.83 goals scored and 1.5 conceded, with 11 total shots and 3.17 on target per match. Their last three at home yielded 0 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss with 0.67 goals scored and 1.67 conceded, hinting at a finishing issue that has carried into recent weeks. They are winless in their last 3 in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Head to head at the Etihad has been one-way traffic. City have won their last 5 home meetings with Newcastle, and 3 of those victories came by a margin of 2 or more goals. The combination of City’s control and an ability to accelerate late has repeatedly broken open this fixture on this ground.</p>\n<p>Across all competitions, City’s baseline remains powerful: in their last 12, they have 6 wins with averages of 2.17 goals scored and 0.92 conceded, and they are undefeated in 80% of their last 20 overall. At home across their last 30 in all competitions, they have won 77%, scoring 2.7 per game and conceding just 0.77, with 7 clean sheets in the last 15 at home.</p>\n<p>EFL Cup-specific trends keep Newcastle in the argument. In the league cup, Newcastle have won 15 of their last 20 and are undefeated in 18 of those 20, with 8 wins by 2 or more goals. City’s EFL Cup record is similarly elite: 11 wins in their last 15 in the competition and undefeated in 16 of their last 20, while winning 11 of their last 12 EFL Cup home matches and going undefeated in 11 of those 12.</p>\n<p>City’s big-home-energy is hard to ignore. They have won by 2 or more goals in 14 of their last 20 home matches in all competitions and kept 7 clean sheets in their last 15 at home. They also come in with an undefeated run of 3, reinforced by sharper shot quality at the Etihad.</p>\n<p>For Newcastle, the away ledger in all competitions is a concern: they have been winless in 16 of their last 20 away matches and lost 50% of their last 14 away. Recent short-term form shows they have been winless in 6 of their last 7 overall, and 3 of those 7 defeats were by 2 or more goals.</p>\n<p>Selection is shaped by notable absences on both sides. Manchester City are without Savinho, Rúben Dias, John Stones, Josko Gvardiol and Mateo Kovacic. Newcastle list Tino Livramento, Jamaal Lascelles, Fabian Schär, Sven Botman and Malick Thiaw as unavailable.</p>\n<p>Manchester City<br/>Goalkeeper: Gianluigi Donnarumma<br/>Defenders: Matheus Nunes, Marc Guéhi, Nathan Aké, Rayan Aït-Nouri<br/>Midfielders: Rodri, Bernardo Silva, Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Jérémy Doku<br/>Attackers: Erling Haaland</p>\n<p>Newcastle United<br/>Goalkeeper: Nick Pope<br/>Defenders: Kieran Trippier, Dan Burn, Alex Murphy, Lewis Hall<br/>Midfielders: Bruno Guimarães, Sandro Tonali, Lewis Miley<br/>Attackers: Harvey Barnes, Nick Woltemade, Anthony Gordon</p>\n<p>City’s flawless recent home run, the 5-match home streak over Newcastle, and the visitors’ away struggles tilt the semi in the hosts’ direction. The algorithm points to Manchester City to win with a 44% probability and a most likely scoreline of 1-0. Given City’s scoring surge at home against a depleted Newcastle back line, a slightly wider margin is on the table. Prediction: Manchester City 2-0.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two sides with contrasting rhythms but matching resilience collide in a quarter-final that reads like a stalemate on paper, yet brims with small edges that could tilt it either way.</p>\n<p>Eduardo Coudet’s Alavés arrive with a solid platform. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 3 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, averaging 1.33 goals scored and 1.17 conceded. At home, the trend sharpens: across their last 3 at Mendizorroza they are 2 wins, 1 draw and 0 losses with 1.67 goals scored and only 0.67 conceded, while pushing up to 15.67 total shots and 7.67 on target with 51% possession.</p>\n<p>Pellegrino Matarazzo’s Real Sociedad are unbeaten in their last 6 in all competitions with 3 wins and 3 draws, scoring 1.83 per game and conceding 1.17. They have done it with a slightly lower average possession of 46.67% but 6.33 shots on target per match points to crisp final-third execution.</p>\n<p>The away profile strengthens La Real’s case. In all competitions, they have won 50% of their last 10 away fixtures and conceded just 0.8 per game, while remaining unbeaten in 9 of their last 11 away matches.</p>\n<p>The head-to-head in Vitoria has leaned toward balance with a home-leaning tilt. In the last 5 Alavés home meetings against Real Sociedad, Alavés have 2 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss. It has typically been attritional, with the hosts often leaning on structure and clean-sheet potential, qualities that mirror their cup-specific home numbers.</p>\n<p>Alavés’ wider sample in all competitions shows a split personality. They have won 50% of their last 12 matches, yet across their last 14 they have lost 50%, an illustration of streaks rather than steady equilibrium. The underlying output sits around 4.83 shots on target and 49.33% possession, which climbs at home, where they have 4 clean sheets in their last 10 and concede only 0.7 per game.</p>\n<p>Real Sociedad have the steadier baseline. In all competitions across their last 18, they have won 50% and are unbeaten in 12 of their last 15. Their averages of 1.78 goals scored, 5.83 shots on target and 50.67% possession underline a controlled, repeatable plan that travels well.</p>\n<p>Cup-only data paints a compelling picture on both sides. Alavés have won 11 of their last 15 in the Copa del Rey, scoring 2.07 and conceding only 0.4, and are unbeaten in 10 of their last 12 in the competition. At home in the cup, they have 78% wins across the last 9, 67% clean sheets and have not been defeated in 89% of those games. They also have 4 wins by 2 or more goals in their last 10 Copa del Rey matches.</p>\n<p>Real Sociedad’s cup pedigree is equally imposing. They have won 73% of their last 30 Copa del Rey fixtures and have not been defeated in 90% of their last 20 in the competition, with 17 wins by 2 or more goals in their last 40. Add the current run in all competitions, where they are unbeaten in 100% of their last 8, and the visiting resilience is clear.</p>\n<p>Alavés have recently alternated between 4-4-2 and 4-1-4-1 but the 4-4-2 has offered balance, pairing sturdy fullbacks with a compact midfield and a front two that can finish quickly. Real Sociedad’s 4-4-2 has been flexible, often morphing through wide midfielders like Takefusa Kubo and Gonçalo Guedes. With Alavés averaging 50.83% possession over their last 6 and La Real comfortable ceding a few points of the ball for sharper final-third work, territory may not dictate the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>Deportivo Alavés<br/>Goalkeeper: Raúl Fernández<br/>Defenders: Jonny Otto, Jon Pacheco, Victor Parada, Nahuel Tenaglia<br/>Midfielders: Denis Suárez, Antonio Blanco, Pablo Ibáñez, Carles Aleñá<br/>Attackers: Lucas Boyé, Toni Martínez</p>\n<p>Real Sociedad<br/>Goalkeeper: Álex Remiro<br/>Defenders: Jon Aramburu, Igor Zubeldia, Jon Martín, Sergio Gómez<br/>Midfielders: Beñat Turrientes, Carlos Soler, Takefusa Kubo, Gonçalo Guedes<br/>Attackers: Mikel Oyarzabal, Brais Méndez</p>\n<p>Alavés: Antonio Sivera. Real Sociedad: Arsen Zakharyan, Yangel Herrera.</p>\n<p>Alavés’ cup-strength at home and Real Sociedad’s broad unbeaten streaks pull this toward parity. The hosts have not been defeated in 89% of their recent Copa del Rey home ties, while the visitors have not been defeated in 12 of their last 15 in all competitions and are unbeaten in 100% of their last 8. With Alavés’ recent home defensive control and La Real’s away resilience, a draw has the highest probability at 40%, with 1-1 the likeliest scoreline.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Holstein Kiel have proven a tough host for Stuttgart in recent encounters at the Holstein-Stadion, setting the stage for an intriguing DFB Pokal quarter-final in Kiel. The away side come into this contest with impressive form and offensive firepower, but the history of close results in this fixture raises the stakes and intrigue ahead of this latest cup clash.</p>\n<p>Holstein Kiel's results in their last 6 matches have leaned toward resilience, with 2 wins, 3 draws, and only 1 loss, while scoring 1.83 goals per match and conceding 1.5. Their performance at home has seen them secure 2 wins from 3, with a consistent average of conceding just 1 goal per match.</p>\n<p>Kiel’s ability to avoid defeat is notable across competitions. Undefeated in 6 of their last 7 matches and drawing 4 of their last 8, they show a certain doggedness, especially at home. However, looking deeper, they have lost 18 of their last 36 home games in all competitions, hinting at vulnerabilities that top opponents can exploit.</p>\n<p>Stuttgart, on the other hand, have enjoyed a powerful run, taking 4 wins from their last 6 matches while averaging 1.83 goals per game and conceding only 1.17. The consistency is evident, as they have been undefeated in 10 out of their last 12 games across all competitions. Their away form is particularly impressive, winning 11 of their last 20, scoring at an average rate of 2.1 per game, and notching clean sheets in half of their last 12 away trips.</p>\n<p>Head-to-head encounters at the Holstein-Stadion have fallen in Kiel’s favor, with the hosts unbeaten in their last two meetings there against Stuttgart, securing one win and a draw from those fixtures. This recent history at home gives Kiel reason for optimism, despite Stuttgart’s strong campaign this season.</p>\n<p>Kiel’s overall performance in the DFB Pokal has been competitive, with the club remaining undefeated in 16 of their last 20 appearances in the competition. Their home matches in the cup underline this solidity, with Kiel going without a loss in five of their last six on home soil. In terms of productivity, they have scored 1.25 goals and conceded 0.88 per DFB Pokal match across the last eight played.</p>\n<p>Stuttgart, for their part, have been clinical and dominant throughout their 2025-26 campaign, particularly evident in the cup where they have 12 wins from the last 15 matches, scoring at an eye-catching clip of 2.47 per game and conceding less than 1. Their ability to win convincingly is reflected in their 40% rate of two-goal-margin victories in the last 20 cup outings, demonstrating the capacity to put games to bed efficiently.</p>\n<p>Kiel demonstrate a knack for drawing out tough matches, as seen with draws in half of their last eight fixtures and their defensive consistency at home. However, Stuttgart’s main trend is their frequent two-goal wins—8 from the last 20 away games—and a strong recent run, including a streak of 3 consecutive wins in all competitions, scoring an average of 2.33 and conceding just 0.67 per match during that span.</p>\n<p>Holstein Kiel</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jonas Krumrey</p>\n<p>Defenders: Marko Ivezic, Ivan Nekic, David Zec, John Tolkin</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Jonas Meffert, Umut Tohumcu, Niklas Niehoff, Jonas Therkelsen</p>\n<p>Attackers: Phil Harres, Steven Skrzybski</p>\n<p>Stuttgart</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Alexander Nübel</p>\n<p>Defenders: Ramon Hendriks, Finn Jeltsch, Maximilian Mittelstädt, Lorenz Assignon</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Angelo Stiller, Atakan Karazor, Jamie Leweling, Badredine Bouanani</p>\n<p>Attackers: Ermedin Demirovic, Deniz Undav</p>\n<p>Stuttgart's ability to generate chances is reflected in their impressive average of 18.5 shots per game over the last 6 matches, a number bolstered by 7.5 shots on target and nearly 59% possession. They are arriving in Kiel with momentum and a clinical attack despite several notable absences in defense such as Vagnoman, Chabot, Zagadou, as well as Tiago Tomás and Jovanovic further upfield.</p>\n<p>Kiel, meanwhile, face some challenges with Patrick Erras, Carl Johansson, and Alexander Bernhardsson all sidelined. Their home form in the cup and recent history against Stuttgart help shore up confidence, but they must guard against Stuttgart’s pace and attacking depth.</p>\n<p>The data signals that Stuttgart have a 49% probability of progressing to the semifinals. While Kiel’s history in the fixture and dogged cup form give them hope, Stuttgart’s firepower and all-round quality should see them edge a tight contest—potentially with a 3-1 scoreline as forecasted by leading algorithms.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Inter enter the quarter-finals with their metrics humming and their strikers in rhythm, while Torino arrive scrapping for control after a choppy run. Strip away the narratives and the data suggests a clear tilt, but the cup has its own cadence and small details matter.</p>\n<p>Inter have won 5 of their last 6 matches in all competitions, scoring 2.17 per game and conceding 0.83 while averaging 18.83 shots and 6.5 on target with 61.83% possession. At home across their last three, it is even punchier: 2 wins and 1 loss with 2.67 scored, 1.67 conceded and a hefty 24.33 shots per match.</p>\n<p>Torino’s last six across all competitions reads 2 wins and 4 losses, with just 0.83 scored and 2.33 conceded, plus 10.5 shots, 3.67 on target and 42.67% possession. Their away trend offers a mixed picture: 50% wins in their last 6 trips but still conceding 2.0 per game, underscoring how much work their back line will face against Inter’s volume.</p>\n<p>Inter’s home record against Torino has been ruthless, with 5 wins from the last 5 such meetings. Extend the lens and Inter have taken 13 of the last 20 encounters in all competitions. Half of Inter’s last six home wins versus Torino arrived by 2+ goals, a telling sign when assessing game state if the first goal lands early.</p>\n<p>Across all competitions, Inter have won 73% of their last 15, scoring 2.2 and conceding 0.8 on average. They have not been defeated in 16 of their last 20 at home and 32 of their last 40 at home in all competitions, with 17 of those 40 home outings won by 2+ goals. The underlying control is evident in sustained shot volume and territorial play.</p>\n<p>Torino’s broader trend is more volatile: they have lost 8 of their last 16 in all competitions, and 3 of their last 7 defeats have been by 2+ goals. There are positives, too: 50% wins in their last 10 and 5 clean sheets in their last 12 away matches in all competitions. Consistency, however, remains an issue when they are pressed high and frequently.</p>\n<p>In the Coppa Italia specifically, Inter have not been defeated in 18 of their last 20 matches and have kept clean sheets in 58% of their last 12 home ties. While their overall cup win rate across the last 12 is 50%, the defensive platform is strong, and 3 wins by 2+ goals have come in their last 7 in the competition.</p>\n<p>Torino’s cup pedigree deserves respect: 14 wins from their last 25 Coppa Italia fixtures and not defeated in 9 of their last 11. Much of their cup excellence has been built on home strength, but the numbers still affirm they are competitive in this tournament phase.</p>\n<p>Cristian Chivu has leaned on a 3-5-2 that floods the final third through wingbacks and an extra runner from midfield. Inter’s last three matches show an uptick in tempo, producing 7.67 shots on target per game across that mini-streak. Marco Baroni’s Torino have alternated between 3-5-2 and 3-1-4-2, often relying on direct outlets into Duván Zapata and Ché Adams with Nikola Vlašić joining second balls.</p>\n<p>Inter’s left flank, with Federico Dimarco’s delivery and Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s timing, squares up against Valentino Lazaro and Saúl Coco. The duel between Lautaro Martínez and Torino’s central trio should dictate Torino’s defensive line height; if forced deep, Torino will need transition precision from Emirhan İlkhan and Casadei to relieve pressure.</p>\n<p>Inter (3-5-2)<br/>Goalkeeper: Yann Sommer<br/>Defenders: Yann Bisseck, Stefan de Vrij, Alessandro Bastoni<br/>Midfielders: Federico Dimarco, Piotr Zieliński, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Davide Frattesi, Luis Henrique<br/>Attackers: Lautaro Martínez, Marcus Thuram</p>\n<p>Torino (3-5-2)<br/>Goalkeeper: Alberto Paleari<br/>Defenders: Saúl Coco, Guillermo Maripán, Adrien Tamèze<br/>Midfielders: Valentino Lazaro, Emirhan İlkhan, Nikola Vlašić, Cesare Casadei, Marcus Pedersen<br/>Attackers: Duván Zapata, Ché Adams</p>\n<p>Inter: Carlos Augusto, Nicolò Barella, Denzel Dumfries. Torino: Cristiano Biraghi, Adam Masina, Ardian Ismajli, Gvidas Gineitis, Zakaria Aboukhlal, Zanos Savva.</p>\n<p>Inter carry superior shot volume, control phases and head-to-head dominance, while Torino’s cup resilience keeps the door ajar if they survive the early press. With Inter not defeated in 18 of their last 20 Coppa Italia matches and Torino losing 8 of their last 16 in all competitions, the lean is clear: Inter to win with a 58% probability, and a plausible scoreline of 3-0.</p>",

The short-term picture at home is steadier: unbeaten across the last three at 1 win and 2 draws, with scoring output at 2.00 per match and 4.00 shots on target. Possession has been low across those samples, just 26.67% at home and 23.83% across the last six overall, which hints at a direct plan built on quick transitions rather than long spells on the ball.</p>\n<p>There is a cautionary trend for the hosts in the broader all-competitions sample. Nice have been winless in 12 of their last 15 matches, a stark 80% marker. Yet the cup picture is less gloomy. In the Coupe de France, Nice have 4 wins in their last 8 and 5 wins across their last 9 home ties, conceding only 0.89 per match over that home cup run. This often looks like a different team once the bracket format compresses risk.</p>\n<p>Montpellier’s last six in all competitions read 4 wins and 2 losses with 1.83 goals scored and only 0.83 conceded per match. Their traveling form has hardened too. They are undefeated in 8 of their last 10 away matches in all competitions, keeping 6 clean sheets across their last 12 away, and showing the kind of defensive economy that translates well in knockout football.</p>\n<p>In the cup specifically, Montpellier have won 10 of their last 15 Coupe de France matches and have not been defeated in 16 of their last 20 in the competition. They have also won by 2 or more goals in 43% of their last 7 Coupe de France outings. The longer historical away sample is more volatile at 60% losses across the last 35 away matches in all competitions, but the fresher trendline points upward.</p>\n<p>The stylistic contrast is stark. Nice average only 8.83 total shots and 2.67 on target across their last six, yet they have found efficiency at home with 12.67 total shots and 4.00 on target in the last three. Montpellier average 9.17 shots and 4.00 on target across their last six with a healthier 41.83% possession. Expect Montpellier to hold more of the ball, while Nice try to spring space for their front line and squeeze set play value.</p>\n<p>Discipline in the box should be decisive. Nice’s cup home sample shows defensive restraint, while Montpellier’s recent away clean sheet rate underlines their structure. With both sides trending to lower possession phases, the first goal has amplified weight in a tie that profiles as low margin.</p>\n<p>Nice absences: Melvin Bard is out with adductor pain, Youssouf Ndayishimiye is sidelined with a cruciate ligament injury, while Moïse Bombito and Mohamed Abdelmonem remain unavailable. Montpellier are without Christopher Jullien.</p>\n<p>Nice probable XI, 4-3-3<br/>Goalkeeper: Yehvann Diouf<br/>Defenders: Antoine Mendy, Dante, Ali Abdi, Jonathan Clauss<br/>Midfielders: Hicham Boudaoui, Morgan Sanson, Charles Vanhoutte, Gabin Bernardeau<br/>Attackers: Isak Jansson, Mohamed-Ali Cho, Elye Wahi</p>\n<p>Montpellier probable XI, 4-1-4-1<br/>Goalkeeper: Simon Ngapandouetnbu<br/>Defenders: Enzo Tchato, Yaël Mouanga, Julien Laporte, Lucas Mincarelli<br/>Midfielders: Becir Omeragic, Yanis Issoufou, Téji Savanier, Nicolas Pays, Everson Jr<br/>Attackers: Alexandre Mendy</p>\n<p>Head to head leans Nice at this ground, but Montpellier’s modern cup form and recent away resilience narrow the gap. Nice’s last nine home meetings with Montpellier have largely gone their way, yet Montpellier’s 16 of 20 undefeated run in the Coupe de France suggests a more balanced coin toss on the night.</p>\n<p>Projection: Under 2.5 goals, with Nice carrying a slight edge to nick it. The model leans Nice at around 37% to win in regulation, and the single most likely scoreline is 1-0 for the hosts.</p>",
