    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Newcastle United hosting Aston Villa at St. James' Park brings together two teams navigating their own challenges and strengths as the Premier League campaign nears its midpoint. Both sides have ambitions at different ends of the table and pride on the line after a tense stalemate earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>The last match between these two sides ended in a 0-0 draw at Villa Park on August 16, 2025. The scoreless result didn't tell the full story, as Newcastle United dominated much of the play.</p>\n<p>Newcastle registered sixteen total shots compared to just three from Villa, while both teams had three shots on target. Possession also skewed heavily towards the Magpies, who held 60% of the ball.</p>\n<p>In terms of dangerous play, Newcastle managed 61 dangerous attacks, nearly doubling Aston Villa's 38. Despite these advantages, the visitors couldn't convert their opportunities, highlighting Villa's defensive resilience and Newcastle's struggles in front of goal during that fixture.</p>\n<p>Newcastle's form over their last six matches has been steady: three wins, two draws, and one defeat, finding the net at an average of 1.83 goals per game while conceding 1.33.</p>\n<p>However, their last three outings saw them go winless, a trend they'll be keen to reverse. At home, they're slightly less secure defensively, conceding 2.33 on average in their last three matches at St. James' Park.</p>\n<p>Aston Villa, meanwhile, have three wins, one draw, and two losses in their latest six. They've scored less frequently than Newcastle over that period (1.33 goals per game) but have matched them defensively, also conceding 1.33 per match.</p>\n<p>Villa have picked up a single win, a draw, and a loss in their three most recent matches as the home team, reflecting a similarly inconsistent spell.</p>\n<p>In the standings, Newcastle are eighth after 22 games, with nine wins, six draws, and seven defeats. Their goal tally sits at 32 scored and 27 conceded, a positive difference but not a large margin.</p>\n<p>Aston Villa’s campaign has been stronger. Occupying third place, they've won thirteen of their twenty-two games, drawn four, and lost five. With 33 scored and 25 conceded, the goal difference of +8 indicates a more clinical and solid side overall.</p>\n<p>Newcastle have avoided defeat in five of their last six matches across all competitions. Their home form is a significant asset, remaining unbeaten in 81% of their last 36 home matches in all competitions and winning 58% of their last 40 Premier League games at St. James' Park.</p>\n<p>Villa travel well, unbeaten in seven of their last eight away matches in all competitions. Their overall record is even more impressive: undefeated in 24 of their past 30 games, while also winning 73% of their last 15 Premier League matches.</p>\n<p>Historically, encounters have swung toward Newcastle when it comes to emphatic wins, as they've secured victory by two or more goals in four of their last ten clashes with Villa.</p>\n<p><strong>Newcastle United</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Nick Pope</p>\n<p>Defenders: Lewis Hall, Malick Thiaw, Lewis Miley, Joelinton</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães, Joe Willock</p>\n<p>Attackers: Anthony Gordon, Yoane Wissa, Harvey Barnes</p>\n<p><strong>Aston Villa</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Emiliano Martínez</p>\n<p>Defenders: Matty Cash, Victor Lindelöf, Ezri Konsa, Ian Maatsen</p>\n<p>Midfielders: John McGinn, Youri Tielemans, Emiliano Buendía, Morgan Rogers, Jadon Sancho</p>\n<p>Attacker: Ollie Watkins</p>\n<p>The last meeting's deadlock and both teams’ robust defensive numbers suggest another closely contested contest. While Villa have been more consistent over the course of the season, Newcastle’s strong record at home can't be ignored.</p>\n<p>Based on current trends and the predicted squads, a draw looks likely with a 35% probability, most plausibly at 1-1. Both sides are reliant on their midfields and have the ability to absorb pressure, so margins are likely to be fine at St. James' Park once again.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Portsmouth and Southampton are poised for a closely contested encounter at Fratton Park. With both teams showing mirrored form patterns and statistics suggesting a tight affair, the stage is set for a tactical battle with no clear favorite.</p>\n<p>Recent history between Portsmouth and Southampton at Fratton Park has been limited but telling. The most notable home clash saw Portsmouth fall to Southampton, losing their only recent home matchup.</p>\n<p>Portsmouth has had a mixed run in the Championship. Over their last 6 matches, they've managed 2 wins, 2 draws, and 2 losses, averaging just 1 goal scored while conceding 2 per match. Their attack has not been prolific, but defensively, they've remained competitive, keeping games tight.</p>\n<p>At home, Portsmouth’s trend continues. In their last 3 outings at Fratton Park, they've recorded 1 win, 1 draw, and 1 loss, with a scoring average of 1.33 goals per game and conceding 2. The home side demonstrates slightly improved possession, sitting at 53.33%, but continue to rely on maximizing limited opportunities.</p>\n<p>Portsmouth’s overall league position is 21st, with 7 wins, 8 draws and 11 defeats in 26 matches. Their 0.88 goals per match comes alongside an average of 1.38 conceded, leading to a -13 goal difference. Wins have been difficult to come by, but notably, they haven’t been defeated in 6 of their last 7 matches in the league, showcasing newfound resilience at a critical point in the season.</p>\n<p>Southampton’s recent form almost mirrors their opponents. Over their last 6 matches, The Saints have also secured 2 wins, 2 draws, and 2 losses, but with a slightly better defensive record, conceding 1.5 goals per game to 1 scored. Their attacking output isn't overwhelming, but they've maintained a disciplined structure, registering higher average possession at 58.17%.</p>\n<p>Away from home, Southampton hasn’t enjoyed sustained success. They have only one win in their last 6 away matches, and are winless in 5 of these. Losses on the road have become frequent as they’ve lost 53% of their last 15 away matches in all competitions, with 35% of the last 37 away games ending in defeats by 2 or more goals.</p>\n<p>In terms of league position, Southampton sits 15th after 28 matches, with 9 wins, 9 draws, and 10 losses. They balance out at 1.43 goals for and against per match, their zero goal difference reflecting their inconsistent nature. Additionally, they haven’t managed a clean sheet in most away matches and are winless in 7 of their last 8 Championship games.</p>\n<p>Looking at potential lineups, Portsmouth have all players available. Based on recent formations and player selections:</p>\n<p><b>Portsmouth Probable Lineup (4-2-3-1):</b></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Nicolas Schmid</p>\n<p>Defenders: Connor Ogilvie, Regan Poole, Conor Shaughnessy, Terry Devlin</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Andre Dozzell, Adrian Segecic, Zak Swanson, Millenic Alli, Conor Chaplin</p>\n<p>Attacker: Colby Bishop</p>\n<p>For Southampton, Mads Roerslev and Jack Stephens are sidelined through injury and miss out. Recent selections and their favored 3-4-2-1 formation guide the likely eleven:</p>\n<p><b>Southampton Probable Lineup (3-4-2-1):</b></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Gavin Bazunu</p>\n<p>Defenders: Nathan Wood, Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Joshua Quarshie</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Ryan Manning, Flynn Downes, Tom Fellows, Caspar Jander</p>\n<p>Attackers: Adam Armstrong, Finn Azaz, Leo Scienza</p>\n<p>The statistical similarities make separating the sides difficult. Both teams are struggling to maintain momentum in the league, and their head-to-head form points toward another tense battle. Given the algorithm’s forecast and the form lines, another close game with under 2.5 goals seems probable, with a 1-1 scoreline and a draw outcome registering a 38% probability.</p>\n<p>In summary, the matchup at Fratton Park brings together two evenly matched teams, both seeking to break out of their cycle of draws and narrow results. Neutral observers could expect a match where defensive discipline and patience are likely to decide the outcome.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Atlético Madrid prepare to face Real Mallorca at the Riyadh Air Metropolitano, looking to build on their impressive home record. With both teams aiming to shift momentum in La Liga, this clash could be pivotal in their respective seasons.</p>\n<p>Atlético Madrid come into this match boasting a formidable run of results both at home and in their broader campaign. Their recent form has been consistent, registering four wins, a draw, and a single defeat in their last six matches. During this period, the side averaged 1.67 goals scored and only 0.83 conceded per match. The home advantage seems to matter as well, with the team firing off more shots and maintaining above 51% possession on average over their last three home games.</p>\n<p>Against Real Mallorca, Atlético have enjoyed the upper hand in recent encounters. In the last five meetings at home, they've triumphed on four occasions and suffered just one defeat. This trend is underscored by their wider dominance in La Liga, sitting third in the standings with a record of twelve wins, five draws, and three losses from twenty games, having produced a robust goal difference of +18.</p>\n<p>Atlético's performances at the Metropolitano are especially noteworthy. They're undefeated in 37 of their last 40 home league matches and have managed to win 13 of the last 15 home outings across all competitions. Clean sheets have also come regularly, achieved in half of their last 30 league home games. Not only has the team shown resilience but they've also demonstrated the ability to control games, boasting a possession average of over 53% recently.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Real Mallorca have struggled to find the consistency required to climb the table. Fourteen points back in 14th place, they've mustered five wins, six draws, and nine defeats so far. Defensively, they have conceded 30 goals, with a negative goal difference of -6 over twenty matches. Recent away form has been a particular area of concern, as Mallorca have failed to win in 6 of their past 7 away matches. Their last six matches overall have yielded only two victories, while they have suffered three losses and one draw.</p>\n<p>Looking at Mallorca's recent attacking output, the team has averaged 1.5 goals for and against per match in their last six games, but their away efforts have often stuttered, with less than one goal scored per game and just about 9.67 shots per match over their last three on the road. On these occasions, possession has also dropped below 46%, indicating limited control when facing host opposition.</p>\n<p>Examining trends, Atlético have won 73% of their last 15 matches in all competitions and stayed undefeated in 81% of their previous 31. Notably, they've achieved wins by two or more goals in 55% of their last 20 home games, suggesting a strong potential for a comfortable victory here. In contrast, Real Mallorca have lost 19 of their last 30 away matches in all competitions, with an 86% winless rate in their recent seven league matches on the road.</p>\n<p>Turning to the lineups, Atlético are expected to continue with their typical 4-4-2 formation. With Clément Lenglet sidelined by injury, the defense should be manned by Llorente, Hancko, Pubill, and Ruggeri, supporting Jan Oblak in goal. The midfield will most likely feature Koke, Barrios, Nico González, and Giuliano Simeone, based on recent appearances, promoting both solidity and creativity. The front line is predicted to include Julián Alvarez and Alexander Sørloth, both having regularly started in Simeone's setup.</p>\n<p><strong>Atlético Madrid Probable Lineup</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jan Oblak</p>\n<p>Defenders: Marcos Llorente, Dávid Hancko, Marc Pubill, Matteo Ruggeri</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Koke, Pablo Barrios, Nico González, Giuliano Simeone</p>\n<p>Attackers: Julián Alvarez, Alexander Sørloth</p>\n<p>For Real Mallorca, Iván Cuéllar and Manu Morlanes are both sidelined. The visitors are likely to stick with Leo Román as goalkeeper. At the back, Valjent, Mojica, Kumbulla, Morey, and possibly Maffeo should feature. The midfield quartet could be Antonio Sánchez, Samú Costa, Sergi Darder, Omar Mascarell, with Vedat Muriqi partnered by Mateo Joseph in attack, tapping into the 4-4-2 that has been frequently used in recent matches.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Mallorca Probable Lineup</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Leo Román</p>\n<p>Defenders: Mateu Morey, Martin Valjent, Marash Kumbulla, Johan Mojica</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Antonio Sánchez, Samú Costa, Antonio Sánchez, Sergi Darder</p>\n<p>Attackers: Vedat Muriqi, Mateo Joseph</p>\n<p>Recent history, form trends and head to head data all point towards Atlético Madrid retaining the edge. The home side’s ability to keep clean sheets and win comfortably at this venue stands in marked contrast to Mallorca’s five defeats in their last nine away league fixtures. A controlled, disciplined approach from Atlético is expected, with the likelihood of an under 2.5 goals outcome and a solid 2-0 home win. The probability stands at 57% for an Atlético Madrid victory, making them clear favorites ahead of this encounter.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">All eyes will turn to Stadion im Borussia-Park as Borussia M'gladbach meet Stuttgart in a Bundesliga fixture where recent form paints a sharp contrast between the two sides. Stuttgart arrive with an impressive unbeaten streak, while M'gladbach seek to steady the ship after a stuttering set of results.</p>\n<p>Borussia M'gladbach have endured mixed fortunes across their last six matches, recording two wins, one draw, and three defeats. Scoring an average of 1.17 goals per match and conceding 1.67 has left room for improvement at both ends of the pitch. Recent home form also reflects their inconsistency, with just one win and two losses in their last three at Borussia-Park.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Stuttgart are one of the Bundesliga's strongest away sides this season. Their last six matches have yielded four wins and two draws, with no defeats. Across those fixtures, Stuttgart have found the net an average of 2.67 times per game and conceded only 0.83, powered by an impressive 56% possession average.</p>\n<p>Direct encounters between these two teams at Borussia-Park have been evenly contested. In the last five home games against Stuttgart, M'gladbach have won two, drawn one, and lost two. However, Stuttgart have been the victors in two of the last three, suggesting the visitors are comfortable in this setting. Notably, M'gladbach have managed to win by two or more goals twice in those five matches at home versus Stuttgart.</p>\n<p>After 18 matches this Bundesliga campaign, M'gladbach sit 11th with 23 goals scored and 29 conceded, holding a negative goal difference of -6. Their league win rate sits at 28% and they have kept a clean sheet in just 40% of their last 10 home games.</p>\n<p>Stuttgart, on the other hand, have ascended to fourth in the standings. With ten wins, three draws, and five losses, they possess a positive goal difference of +7, courtesy of 33 goals scored and 26 conceded. Stuttgart have won 60% of their last 15 Bundesliga matches and remained undefeated in 80% of those encounters, underlining their consistency.</p>\n<p>M'gladbach's long-term struggles are evident, as they've been winless in 80% of their last 25 Bundesliga matches and have lost 50% of their last 18 at home. Additionally, they've been unable to win 12 out of their last 15 at Borussia-Park. However, when they do win, they have a tendency to do so convincingly: 40% of their last ten Bundesliga victories have been by two or more goals.</p>\n<p>Stuttgart are enjoying a remarkable run, not having lost in 81% of their last 16 in all competitions and going undefeated in each of their past six matches. They've also kept five clean sheets in their last 12 away fixtures and won in half of those league outings by at least a two-goal margin.</p>\n<p>Borussia M'gladbach face several absentees: Kevin Diks, Lukas Ullrich, Robin Hack, Tim Kleindienst, Jonas Omlin, and Fabio Chiarodia are all sidelined. Among their most regularly used players and with recent lineups in mind, a 3-4-2-1 formation is expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Borussia M'gladbach</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Moritz Nicolas</p>\n<p>Defenders: Philipp Sander, Nico Elvedi, Joe Scally</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Yannik Engelhardt, Luca Netz, Franck Honorat, Rocco Reitz</p>\n<p>Attackers: Florian Neuhaus, Haris Tabakovic, Jens Castrop</p>\n<p>Stuttgart have injury concerns for Dan-Axel Zagadou, Josha Vagnoman, Jeff Chabot, Luca Jaquez, Angelo Stiller, Tiago Tomás, and Lazar Jovanovic, all likely unavailable. Stuttgart tend to line up in a 4-2-3-1 with these absentees considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Stuttgart</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Alexander Nübel</p>\n<p>Defenders: Ramon Hendriks, Maximilian Mittelstädt, Pascal Stenzel, Jamie Leweling</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Chris Führich, Atakan Karazor, Nikolas Nartey, Jamie Leweling</p>\n<p>Attackers: Deniz Undav, Ermedin Demirovic, Maximilian Mittelstädt</p>\n<p>Stuttgart's recent run of results and midfield control set them apart. Their pressing game and attacking efficiency, reflected by over 15 shots on average per game, contrasts M'gladbach's struggle for composure at the back. M'gladbach will be hoping home turf and attacking moments from Tabakovic or Neuhaus can keep them in the contest, but the visitors' consistency and robust defense could tip the balance.</p>\n<p>The prediction leans towards a Stuttgart victory with a 49% win probability. Given both teams' recent trends and Stuttgart's strong goal scoring record lately, expect an open match with a predicted scoreline of 1-3 and over 2.5 goals likely.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">As Sassuolo prepare to host Cremonese at the MAPEI Stadium in Serie A, both sides are looking to break undesirable streaks and regain momentum. Recent encounters and a close proximity in the standings set the stage for a tightly contested match between two teams desperate to improve their fortunes.</p>\n<p>Sassuolo have had their struggles in the league, with their last six matches yielding no victories, two draws, and four defeats. They have averaged just 0.33 goals scored per match during this period, while conceding 1.5. Their attacking inefficiency is even clearer at home, having also failed to win any of their last three, managing just a solitary goal while conceding five.</p>\n<p>Cremonese find themselves on a similar trajectory, having also failed to register a win in their last six league fixtures. With three draws and three defeats, the visitors have maintained a low output in front of goal, scoring just 0.33 on average while conceding 1.67 per outing. Their away form mirrors those struggles, with no victories in their last three games on the road.</p>\n<p>Sassuolo's home record against Cremonese reveals weakness. In their last three meetings at the MAPEI Stadium, Sassuolo have lost twice and won only once—far from dominant against this opposition. For two teams that need points, this trend could play a psychological role as they line up again in Reggio Emilia.</p>\n<p>With 21 matches played, only one point separates the sides in the Serie A standings. Sassuolo, currently 14th, have managed six wins, five draws, and ten losses, scoring 23 and conceding 28, resulting in a goal difference of minus five. Their 1.1 goals per game average suggests a team that finds the net but does not do so prolifically.</p>\n<p>Cremonese sit just above them in 13th, racking up five wins, eight draws, and eight defeats. The visitors have scored 20 and conceded 28, holding a slightly worse goal difference but with a more stable record of avoiding losses via draws rather than wins.</p>\n<p>Sassuolo have struggled for consistency, losing 50% of their last 14 matches across all competitions. They have also been winless in 12 of their last 15, and are winless in 6 of their past 7 at home. However, their longer-term home record does bring some positivity, with a 60% win rate over their last 30 home matches, showing potential to bounce back in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p>Cremonese face their own set of issues. They are winless in 12 of their last 15 matches and have not secured victory in 8 of their last 10 away clashes. Draws are becoming a feature, with three in their last six, indicating an ability to grind out results even when not firing on all cylinders.</p>\n<p>Sassuolo</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Arijanet Murić<br/>Defenders: Josh Doig, Sebastian Walukiewicz, Jay Idzes, Tarik Muharemović<br/>Midfielders: Nemanja Matic, Luca Lipani, Aster Vranckx<br/>Attackers: Armand Laurienté, Andrea Pinamonti, Alieu Fadera</p>\n<p>With Ismaël Koné, Edoardo Pieragnolo, Fali Candé, and Kristian Thorstvedt sidelined, Grosso is likely to reinforce midfield stability with Vranckx and Lipani alongside Matic in a 4-3-3, aiming for improved creativity and support for the attacking trio.</p>\n<p>Cremonese</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Emil Audero<br/>Defenders: Federico Baschirotto, Matteo Bianchetti, Filippo Terracciano<br/>Midfielders: Dennis Johnsen, Giuseppe Pezzella, Alberto Grassi, Romano Floriani Mussolini, Alessio Zerbin<br/>Attackers: Jamie Vardy, Federico Bonazzoli</p>\n<p>Davide Nicola’s 3-5-2 could see minor tweaks, as Warren Bondo and Martín Payero miss out, and Antonio Sanabria's involvement is uncertain due to muscle fatigue. The midfield is expected to be marshalled by Grassi and Mussolini, with Vardy and Bonazzoli spearheading the attack.</p>\n<p>Both sides carry notable negative streaks into this contest: Sassuolo are winless in all of their last seven and Cremonese have not won in the same span. Neither side is currently sharper in attack, and defensive vulnerabilities are apparent. The Forebet algorithm forecasts a 1-1 draw with a probability of 39%, reflecting the similarities in recent form and performance. Unless either squad finds a sudden uplift, another share of the points seems the most plausible outcome at the MAPEI Stadium.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Stade de la Beaujoire prepares for a critical meeting, as Nantes host Nice in a Ligue 1 battle where both sides look to reverse a challenging run of results. With each team only a point apart in the league standings, this matchup could play a pivotal role in shaping their trajectories this season.</p>\n<p>The recent head-to-head record at Nantes' home ground paints a balanced picture, with Nantes winning only two of the last ten, drawing four, and losing four against Nice. Neither outfit has clearly dominated, often resulting in cagey encounters.</p>\n<p>Nantes enter this round positioned 16th in the league, struggling to escape the lower reaches of the table. Their campaign has included three wins, five draws, and ten losses across eighteen matches, with a challenging goal difference of minus thirteen after scoring just seventeen and conceding thirty.</p>\n<p>Recent form has not provided much comfort. Nantes have managed two wins, one draw, and three defeats in their last six outings, but their offensive output stands at 1.83 goals scored per match, with 2 goals conceded on average. Perhaps more worrying is that in their most recent three home games, they are winless, have scored just once per match, and averaged only 27.33% possession, underlining ongoing difficulties in controlling games at home.</p>\n<p>Nice, just one spot above at 15th, have not fared much better. Out of eighteen Ligue 1 games, they've secured five wins and suffered ten losses, with a disappointing goals against tally of thirty-five. Despite scoring marginally more than Nantes, with twenty-one goals, their defensive frailties are even more pronounced.</p>\n<p>Their last six fixtures reveal just one victory, two draws, and three losses. Offensively, Nice have averaged a modest 0.83 goals per match, while allowing 1.83 goals on the other end. Even when on their own turf, Nice have failed to impress in their last three, picking up only one point and suffering from an even higher rate of conceded goals, giving up 2.67 per game in that stretch.</p>\n<p>Long-term trends are also problematic for both teams. Nantes have been winless in 21 of their last 26 Ligue 1 matches, and at home, have failed to win 31 of their last 38 in the league. Recent matches have seen them lose by two or more goals in five of their last 13 outings. For Nice, the away form is equally concerning: winless in 80% of their last 20 away games in all competitions, and losing the same percentage of their last ten in Ligue 1.</p>\n<p>Looking at probable lineups, Nantes will likely continue with a 4-4-2 shape based on recent selections. Their most used starters, considering fitness and availability, should be:</p>\n<p><strong>Nantes</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Anthony Lopes<br/>Defenders: Chidozie Awaziem, Nicolas Cozza, Tylel Tati, Kelvin Amian<br/>Midfielders: Johann Lepenant, Deiver Machado, Junior Mwanga, Francis Coquelin<br/>Attackers: Matthis Abline, Ignatius Ganago</p>\n<p>For Nice, after recent rotations, a 4-3-3 looks probable, aiming to reinforce their attack and midfield balance. The most likely starting eleven is:</p>\n<p><strong>Nice</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Maxime Dupé<br/>Defenders: Melvin Bard, Juma Bah, Kojo Peprah Oppong, Jonathan Clauss<br/>Midfielders: Salis Abdul Samed, Morgan Sanson, Charles Vanhoutte<br/>Attackers: Jérémie Boga, Isak Jansson, Mohamed-Ali Cho</p>\n<p>Offensively, Nantes continue to search for a consistent cutting edge, with their shooting metrics hinting at an ongoing struggle in the final third, especially at home. Nice, on the other hand, create more shooting opportunities but have been wasteful in front of goal, while also struggling defensively.</p>\n<p>Algorithms tilt this contest narrowly in Nantes' favor, projecting a 2-1 win for the hosts with a 41% probability and an expectation that the match could feature over 2.5 goals. This scoring outlook fits with the recent defensive vulnerabilities both sides have displayed.</p>\n<p>Both Nantes and Nice have much at stake, entering this fixture each eager to end frustrating sequences and gain distance from a potential relegation battle. The pressure is on to seize points, and a managerial reshuffle is not anticipated for either squad at this time.</p>\n<p>As they prepare to face off, the outcome may hinge on which side can better capitalize on their opponent's defensive inconsistency and rediscover some form in front of goal. Recent statistics suggest opportunities will present themselves, but whether either team can grasp them remains the key question for this round.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">As the Eredivisie regular season progresses into its 20th round, SC Telstar welcome AZ Alkmaar to the BUKO Stadion. Both teams approach the clash with plenty on the line, but recent performances and their previous encounter offer compelling talking points.</p>\n<p>In their last meeting, AZ Alkmaar edged past SC Telstar with a 2-1 victory on October 5, 2025. The match was intensely contested, but AZ demonstrated dominance in key areas. With 27 total shots compared to Telstar's 14, AZ consistently pressed forward, recording 10 shots on goal against Telstar's 5. Ball possession also favored AZ at 59%, underlining a level of control that eventually translated into goals from Mexx Meerdink (15’ pen.), Matej Sin (47’), and Telstar’s Tyrese Noslin (61’). Despite Telstar rallying in the second half, AZ's early initiative set the tone.</p>\n<p>Turning attention to current form, SC Telstar have won 3, drawn 2, and lost 1 of their last 6, showing some resilience. They have averaged 2.33 goals scored per match, but conceding 1.5 indicates defensive vulnerabilities. At home, fortunes waver: Telstar have not won in any of their last 3 at the BUKO Stadion, drawing once and losing twice, while conceding at a rate of 2.33 per match.</p>\n<p>Looking further back, Telstar’s home misfortunes are notable. They are winless in 11 of their last 12 Eredivisie home games, a run that underscores why they currently sit 16th in the standings. Their defense has struggled, surrendering 32 goals in 19 games with a goal difference of -8.</p>\n<p>Conversely, AZ Alkmaar’s form has been mixed. In their last 6 matches, they have 2 wins, 2 draws, and 2 defeats, with an average of 2 goals scored and 1.33 conceded. They show intent offensively, firing 16.33 shots per game and 6.83 on target, and maintain healthy average possession above 55%. Yet, their away form remains balanced — 7 wins and 7 losses in their last 14 on the road in all competitions.</p>\n<p>AZ have also suffered inconsistency lately in the league, failing to win in 7 of their last 8 Eredivisie matches. Still, their ability to create chances stands out, and their overall 7th place is a fair reflection of competitive output, with 34 goals scored and a slender positive goal difference.</p>\n<p>For this matchup, squad availability may influence both sides notably. Telstar will miss Cedric Hatenboer through suspension, affecting midfield options. For AZ Alkmaar, several players are ruled out, including goalkeeper Rome Jayden Owusu-Oduro, Sven Mijnans, Andrea Natali, Mexx Meerdink, and Jordy Clasie due to various injuries and national team duty.</p>\n<p>Given recent lineups and these absences, the probable lineups project as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>SC Telstar (3-4-2-1)</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Ronald Koeman Jr.</p>\n<p>Defenders: Danny Bakker, Guus Offerhaus, Neville Ogidi Nwankwo</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Jeff Hardeveld, Tyrese Noslin, Nils Rossen, Tyrone Owusu</p>\n<p>Attackers: Milan Zonneveld, Patrick Brouwer, Jochem Ritmeester van de Kamp</p>\n<p><strong>AZ Alkmaar (4-2-3-1)</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jeroen Zoet</p>\n<p>Defenders: Wouter Goes, Alexandre Penetra, Elijah Dijkstra, Mees de Wit</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Peer Koopmeiners, Kasper Boogaard</p>\n<p>Midfielders (Advanced): Weslley Patati, Isak Jensen, Kees Smit</p>\n<p>Attacker: Troy Parrott</p>\n<p>The tactical setup for both sides mirrors their recent outings, but AZ’s midfield, bolstered by Koopmeiners and Boogaard, could take advantage of Telstar’s midline reshuffle. Troy Parrott’s presence upfront offers AZ a dynamic threat, while Patati and Jensen are expected to support with width and energy.</p>\n<p>The predictive model points toward an AZ Alkmaar victory, with a 51% likelihood of an away win and a projected final outcome leaning towards a 2-0 scoreline in their favor.</p>\n<p>Momentum appears tilting towards AZ Alkmaar, especially if they can recapture some of their attacking verve seen in the previous encounter. For Telstar, arresting their home struggles will require a marked defensive improvement and clinical edge up front.</p>",
