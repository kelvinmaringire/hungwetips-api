    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">West Ham face Sunderland at the London Stadium in a fixture with plenty riding on it for both sides. With the Hammers in desperate need of points and the Black Cats building a solid reputation for resilience, this promises to be a tactical contest with fine margins likely to decide the outcome.</p>\n<p>The most recent meeting between these two sides ended in a comprehensive win for Sunderland, who claimed a 3-0 victory on home turf. Despite West Ham enjoying 63% of possession and generating more dangerous attacks (55 compared to Sunderland's 29), they found themselves undone by clinical finishing and compact defending.</p>\n<p>Eliezer Mayenda broke the deadlock just after the hour mark, before Daniel Ballard and Wilson Isidor added late goals to complete the story. Intriguingly, Sunderland managed to score from half as many shots on target as West Ham, highlighting the efficiency that West Ham's attack lacked in that fixture.</p>\n<p>Though West Ham held the ball for long periods, their inability to penetrate a stubborn Sunderland defense echoed a theme that’s troubled them throughout the campaign.</p>\n<p>West Ham’s form in the last six games makes for grim reading. They have picked up just one win, drawn twice, and lost three times. With only 1 goal scored per game on average and 1.67 conceded, both ends of the pitch are a concern.</p>\n<p>At home, their struggles persist. In their last three at the London Stadium, West Ham haven’t managed a victory, drawing two and losing one. Despite averaging over 14 shots per game, the end product has not matched the promise of their build-up play.</p>\n<p>Sunderland have exhibited greater stability. Across their last six matches, they have one win but an impressive four draws, losing just once. While their goal tally stands at an average of 0.83 per match, their defense has kept them in contention, conceding a manageable 1.17. The trend underlines Sunderland's capacity to keep matches tight and difficult for their opponents.</p>\n<p>West Ham sit 18th after 22 games, with just four wins to their name and a worrying tally of 44 goals conceded. Their goal difference of minus 20 underscores the scale of the task ahead if they are to move clear of the danger zone. The Hammers’ home record compounds the problem, as 75% of their last 12 home league games have ended in defeat.</p>\n<p>Sunderland, in contrast, have emerged as a tough side to defeat, occupying ninth with a balanced record: eight wins, nine draws, and just five defeats from their 22 league fixtures. Their even goal difference (23 for, 23 against) reflects the disciplined approach Régis Le Bris has instilled.</p>\n<p>West Ham have struggled for traction for a prolonged spell. They’ve been winless in 85% of their last 20 matches in all competitions, and have suffered defeat in 16 of their last 30. At home, the difficulties persist: 13 of their last 15 have not resulted in victory.</p>\n<p>Sunderland, meanwhile, have proven very difficult to beat. They remain undefeated in 82% of their last 11 across all competitions and have lost only four of their last 20 Premier League matches. Half of their last 12 league games have ended level, underlining their tendency to share the spoils. On their travels, draws have also been a frequent outcome, with four of the last eight away matches yielding a point.</p>\n<p><strong>West Ham United</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Alphonse Areola</p>\n<p>Defenders: Kyle Walker-Peters, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Maximilian Kilman, Oliver Scarles</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Crysencio Summerville, Mateus Fernandes, Jarrod Bowen, Soungoutou Magassa, Freddie Potts</p>\n<p>Attackers: Callum Wilson</p>\n<p><strong>Sunderland</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Robin Roefs</p>\n<p>Defenders: Nordi Mukiele, Omar Alderete, Dan Ballard, Dennis Cirkin</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Lutsharel Geertruida, Enzo Le Fée, Granit Xhaka, Simon Adingra, Trai Hume</p>\n<p>Attackers: Brian Brobbey</p>\n<p>Given West Ham’s protracted winless streak and Sunderland’s discipline and ability to grind out draws, this is likely to be a tightly-fought contest. Sunderland’s undefeated run in 16 of their last 20 league matches gives them the edge in stability, while West Ham will be desperate to reverse their fortunes on home soil.</p>\n<p>The prediction algorithm suggests a draw as the most probable outcome, rated at 38% probability. With both teams often finding goals hard to come by, a 1-1 scoreline seems plausible as West Ham look to arrest their slide and Sunderland aim to extend their impressive run of resilience.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Millwall prepare to host Charlton Athletic at The Den in a clash that could shape the complexion of their campaigns. With home advantage and an impressive record against their South London rivals, the Lions have a prime opportunity to solidify their position in the Championship playoff spots.</p>\n<p>When Millwall and Charlton Athletic meet at The Den, the stage is often set for a fiercely contested affair. Their recent history, however, tilts notably in Millwall's favor. In the last two occasions Charlton have visited SE16, Millwall have emerged victorious both times, suggesting a psychological edge and familiarity with exploiting home territory.</p>\n<p>Millwall’s performance this season has been largely dependable, especially within the fortress of their home ground. Sitting 5th in the table after 28 fixtures—tallying 13 wins, 7 draws and 8 losses—the Lions have turned The Den into a stronghold. Defensively sound and disciplined, they have conceded only 0.67 goals per match across their last three home games while consistently maintaining clean sheets in 9 of the past 20 at home in all competitions.</p>\n<p>The Lions have also displayed resilience, remaining undefeated in 83% of their last 12 home matches in both all competitions and specifically in the Championship. Equally telling is their recent record overall—three wins in their previous six fixtures, with just two defeats. While their attack averages 1.33 goals at home in the last three matches, the defensive metrics reinforce their confidence heading into this contest.</p>\n<p>Charlton Athletic, meanwhile, arrive in a more precarious position, occupying 18th place with 27 matches played. Their last six outings have brought only one victory, coupled with two draws and three defeats. The Addicks have scored just 1.17 per game, and with an average of two goals conceded, questions about their backline linger, especially away from home.</p>\n<p>A run of form underscores Charlton’s recent frustrations. They have failed to win in 10 out of their last 12 away matches in all competitions and have suffered defeat in 50% of those trips. Furthermore, in the league, Charlton have not claimed victory in 13 of their most recent 16 fixtures—a run that highlights how consistency has been elusive for Nathan Jones's side.</p>\n<p>The head-to-head narrative also offers little comfort to Charlton. They have fallen short in 3 of the last 5 meetings with Millwall, with every recent trip to The Den ending without points. Their attacking efforts have struggled to break down robust Millwall rearguards, an issue compounded by their comparative inefficiency in front of goal away from home (averaging just 2.67 shots on target in their last three away fixtures).</p>\n<p>On the team news front, Millwall will be without Danny McNamara, Will Smallbone, and Lukas Jensen due to long-term injuries. For Charlton, Luke Chambers and Jérôme Roussillon remain sidelined, challenging squad depth in defence and midfield. Using patterns from recent selections and these absences, probable starting lineups shape up as follows:</p>\n<p>Millwall (expected formation: 4-2-3-1)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Max Crocombe</p>\n<p>Defenders: Zak Sturge, Tristan Crama, Jake Cooper, Caleb Taylor</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Billy Mitchell, Thierno Ballo, Camiel Neghli, Femi Azeez, Macaulay Langstaff</p>\n<p>Attackers: Mihailo Ivanovic</p>\n<p>Charlton Athletic (expected formation: 3-1-4-2)</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Thomas Kaminski</p>\n<p>Defenders: Macaulay Gillesphey, Lloyd Jones, Reece Burke</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Conor Coventry, Kayne Ramsay, Karoy Anderson, Tyreece Campbell, Joe Rankin-Costello</p>\n<p>Attackers: Miles Leaburn, Charlie Kelman</p>\n<p>Statistically, Millwall's edge is reinforced by strong defensive numbers and a reliable home record, while Charlton’s inability to secure results on their travels remains an issue. Add in the prediction algorithms, which point towards a home win and multiple goals likely, and it is clear that Millwall will look to play on the front foot.</p>\n<p>The forecasted likelihood of Millwall winning stands at 52%. Historical data, home strength, and current form combine to make Millwall favorites to pick up another three points and continue their fine run against Charlton at The Den.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Rayo Vallecano and Osasuna are set for a tense encounter at Vallecas, with both sides boasting strong defensive records and a recent history of close contests. Both teams occupy mid-table positions and are keen to solidify their footing in the league as they go head-to-head in Madrid.</p>\n<p>Encounters between Rayo Vallecano and Osasuna have been remarkably balanced. In the last three meetings, each side has managed a win, with one match resulting in a draw. This symmetry sets the stage for another closely fought contest, particularly as both teams continue searching for a spark to improve their league standing.</p>\n<p>Looking further back, their head-to-head clashes frequently feature narrow scorelines and tactical battles, generally reflecting the organized approach both squads bring to the pitch.</p>\n<p>Rayo Vallecano enter the match with a recent run of mixed results. Their last six matches have yielded two wins, a draw, and three losses. Notably, on home turf, Vallecano appear far more resilient, remaining undefeated in their last three games with two victories and a single draw. Significantly, they have allowed just 0.67 goals per home game during this span and kept their goal largely protected, demonstrating defensive discipline.</p>\n<p>Osasuna, meanwhile, have secured two wins, three draws, and just one defeat in their last six outings. Their away form points to challenges, going winless in 85% of their last 20 away fixtures. Despite this, they have shown a knack for making games difficult for their opponents, with four draws in their last eight away games.</p>\n<p>Rayo Vallecano currently sit in 13th place after 20 league matches, accumulating five wins and seven draws. They have found the net 16 times while conceding 25, resulting in a goal difference of minus nine. Their average possession (54.67%) and total shots per match (14.67) suggest a preference for controlled, measured football, though turning dominance into goals has been a persistent issue.</p>\n<p>Osasuna are just a notch above in 12th, with six victories, four draws, and ten losses. Offensively, they average 1.05 goals per game and have a slightly better defensive record than their hosts, conceding 1.2 per game for a goal difference of minus three.</p>\n<p>Rayo Vallecano have drawn 50% of their last 10 La Liga matches, showing a pattern of hard-fought games where neither side gives much away. Staying undefeated in 25 of their last 30 home games in all competitions, they have demonstrated serious staying power at Vallecas. Clean sheets have come in 42% of their last 12 home league outings, underscoring their defensive focus.</p>\n<p>Osasuna's main trend points to resilience but not always to victory, with a staggering 85% winless rate in their last 20 away games. They do, however, have a strong record of not losing, going undefeated in 80% of their last 10 matches in all competitions. They frequently force stalemates, as evidenced by a 50% draw rate in their last six fixtures.</p>\n<p>Based on recent lineups and sidelined players, here are the most likely starting XIs:</p>\n<p>Rayo Vallecano:</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Augusto Batalla<br/>Defenders: Andrei Rațiu, Pep Chavarría, Florian Lejeune, Nobel Mendy<br/>Midfielders: Pedro Díaz, Isi Palazón, Óscar Valentín, Álvaro García<br/>Attackers: Jorge de Frutos, Carlos Martín</p>\n<p>Osasuna:</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Sergio Herrera<br/>Defenders: Jorge Herrando, Valentin Rosier, Alejandro Catena, Javi Galán<br/>Midfielders: Lucas Torró, Jon Moncayola, Rubén García, Victor Muñoz, Aimar Oroz<br/>Attackers: Ante Budimir</p>\n<p>With both teams known for defensive organization and their recent encounters often producing few goals, this contest shapes up to be another closely-run affair. Given Vallecano’s home resilience and Osasuna’s away caution, a stalemate appears likeliest.</p>\n<p>Draw probability: 42% (estimated scoreline 0-0, reflecting solid defending from both teams and challenges in attack).</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Eintracht Frankfurt host Hoffenheim at Deutsche Bank Park for a Bundesliga fixture that pits a solid home side against one of the division’s most consistent performers. Both teams boast attacking threats, but it’s Hoffenheim’s recent form that suggests they could edge this encounter.</p>\n<p>Recent meetings between these sides in Frankfurt have seen the home team dominate. Eintracht Frankfurt have won 6 of their last 10 home matches against Hoffenheim, drawing 3 and losing just once. This historical edge will give Frankfurt confidence, though current form tells a more nuanced story.</p>\n<p>Frankfurt’s performances in the league have been mixed. Standing 7th after 18 matches, they have accumulated 7 wins, 6 draws and 5 defeats, with a goal tally of 38 for and 39 against. That’s an average of 2.11 goals scored and 2.17 conceded per game, highlighting both their attacking potential and defensive vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Over their last 6 matches, Frankfurt have recorded just a single win alongside 3 draws and 2 losses. Their attack has averaged 1.83 goals per match, but defensive lapses have seen them concede 2 per game in the same span. Notably, they’ve failed to win in 8 of their last 10 matches across all competitions, and have gone without victory in their previous 4 outings.</p>\n<p>On home soil, however, they remain a tough nut to crack. Across their last 7 home matches, Frankfurt have stayed undefeated in 86% of games, and in Bundesliga play, they are undefeated in 83% of their previous 40 home fixtures. They have also managed to keep clean sheets in 3 of their last 7 games at Deutsche Bank Park.</p>\n<p>Hoffenheim are 3rd in the Bundesliga after 17 matches. They’ve picked up 10 wins, 3 draws and 4 losses, netting 35 goals and conceding only 21, for a robust +14 goal difference. Their defensive resolve, conceding an average of just 1.24 goals per game, is one of the main reasons they’re perched near the top.</p>\n<p>Their recent run has been exceptional, taking 4 wins and a draw from the last 6 games, with only a single defeat. During that stretch, Hoffenheim have averaged 2.17 goals scored and just 0.67 conceded per outing. They come into this match undefeated in their last 4 fixtures, and over their last 16 matches in all competitions, they haven’t lost in 81% of them.</p>\n<p>On the road, Hoffenheim have continued to impress, unbeaten in 92% of their last 12 away matches, and winning 50% of those. Their record for decisive wins is also notable: in the last 12 league outings, they have won by 2 or more goals in 50% of matches.</p>\n<p>In terms of player availability, both sides are missing several key figures. Frankfurt are without Younes Ebnoutalib, Hugo Larsson, Michy Batshuayi, Elias Baum, Mario Götze, and Timothy Chandler. Hoffenheim miss Dennis Geiger, Kelven Frees, Grischa Prömel, Alexander Prass, Ihlas Bebou, Cole Campbell, Adam Hlozek, and Koki Machida. Each unavailable player narrows the tactical choices available to the managers, especially with multiple regular starters sidelined.</p>\n<p>Given recent lineups and the sidelined list, Frankfurt are likely to deploy a 4-2-3-1 formation:</p>\n<p><strong>Eintracht Frankfurt</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Kauã Santos</p>\n<p>Defenders: Rasmus Kristensen, Robin Koch, Arthur Theate, Aurèle Amenda</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Noah Fenyö, Mahmoud Dahoud, Ritsu Doan, Oscar Højlund, Nathaniel Brown</p>\n<p>Attackers: Arnaud Kalimuendo</p>\n<p>Hoffenheim, sticking to their recent setups, are likely to use a 4-2-3-1 with these starters:</p>\n<p><strong>Hoffenheim</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Oliver Baumann</p>\n<p>Defenders: Vladimír Coufal, Robin Hranac, Bernardo, Albian Hajdari</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Wouter Burger, Leon Avdullahu, Fisnik Asllani, Andrej Kramaric, Tim Lemperle</p>\n<p>Attackers: Max Moerstedt</p>\n<p>Looking at the trends and current performances, Hoffenheim’s sharper attack and stronger recent record suggest they have the advantage, with the algorithm projecting a 41% probability for a Hoffenheim win by a 2-1 margin. Frankfurt’s home record and past dominance over Hoffenheim in direct encounters cannot be ignored, but recent form may just tip the contest in the visitors’ favour.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Calcio Como enters this Serie A clash with momentum on their side, looking to assert dominance once again against Torino following a resounding victory in their last meeting. The home team’s recent form has positioned them as a formidable opponent, while Torino arrives searching for stability after mixed recent results.</p>\n<p>The previous encounter between these two teams in November 2025 set a high bar for this fixture. Calcio Como overwhelmed Torino 5-1 on the road, dictating play with 65% ball possession and tallying 15 total shots, 7 of which were on target. Jayden Addai struck twice, reinforcing Calcio Como’s control, and further goals from Nikola Vlašić (penalty for Torino), Nico Paz, Martin Baturina, and Jacobo Ramón highlighted a comprehensive team display. Notably, Torino struggled to generate offensive pressure, managing only 2 shots on goal and trailing significantly in dangerous attacks, 53 to 34.</p>\n<p>Recent trends show Calcio Como in strong form. Over their last 6 matches, they have secured 4 wins, 1 draw, and just a single defeat, averaging 2 goals scored per outing while conceding only 0.67. Importantly, at home over the last 12 matches in all competitions, Como has remained undefeated 92% of the time, with 6 clean sheets earned in that span.</p>\n<p>Calcio Como’s possession play stands out as a key strength, boasting an average of 65% across their last 6 league matches and maintaining over 61% on average over the last 20. In home fixtures, this approach translates to consistent control and a steady flow of dangerous attacks, with 46.92 per home contest.</p>\n<p>Torino’s recent performances, however, have been less consistent. In their last 6 Serie A outings, Marco Baroni’s side has managed 2 victories and endured 4 defeats, conceding 1.67 goals per match. They’ve averaged just 1.33 goals for and only 46.83% possession—a decisive gap compared to Calcio Como’s dominance over the ball.</p>\n<p>Looking deeper at trends, Torino has lost 50% of their last 14 away matches in all competitions, while their away defense has been somewhat susceptible, with just 5 clean sheets over their last 12 games. Moreover, the team has struggled to avoid defeats by multiple goals, dropping 5 of their last 13 away matches in Serie A by a margin of 2 or more.</p>\n<p>In the last 3 head-to-head meetings, Como has won two, cementing a psychological edge in this battle. Their home record over the past year underscores their reliability at Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia, while Torino’s position in 12th place with a negative goal difference suggests an uphill battle.</p>\n<p>Calcio Como currently sits 6th in the standings, with 10 wins, 7 draws, and only 4 losses from 21 matches. Their defense, conceding just 16 goals so far, is among the league's most resilient. On the other hand, Torino has scored just 21 and conceded 34, underlining their defensive challenges.</p>\n<p>Both squads will contend with missing personnel. For Como, Nikola Cavlina, Diego Carlos, Assane Diao, and Álvaro Morata are unavailable due to injury or international duty. Torino will be without Emirhan İlkhan, Zanos Savva, and Zakaria Aboukhlal. Their absence may influence tactical decisions and depth, especially in midfield and attack.</p>\n<p>The probable starting elevens, adjusting for sidelined players and looking at recent formations, project as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Calcio Como</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jean Butez</p>\n<p>Defenders: Marc Oliver Kempf, Jacobo Ramón, Alberto Moreno, Ignace Van der Brempt</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Nico Paz, Máximo Perrone, Jesús Rodríguez, Mërgim Vojvoda, Lucas Da Cunha</p>\n<p>Attackers: Anastasios Douvikas</p>\n<p><strong>Torino</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Alberto Paleari</p>\n<p>Defenders: Guillermo Maripán, Saba Sazonov, Ardian Ismajli</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Nikola Vlašić, Valentino Lazaro, Cesare Casadei, Adrien Tamèze, Gvidas Gineitis</p>\n<p>Attackers: Giovanni Simeone, Alieu Njie</p>\n<p>Given the difference in form, ball control, and defensive solidity, Calcio Como holds the advantage. The prediction leans in their favor for a 1-0 win, with a 52% chance of securing all three points as they look to strengthen their push in the top six.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">The Ligue 1 campaign resumes at Roazhon Park as Rennes prepare to face Lorient. Both sides approach this fixture with impressive recent records but distinct objectives in the standings. With Rennes keen to consolidate their push for a European position and Lorient continuing a quietly impressive unbeaten stretch, this matchup promises plenty of intrigue for close observers of the French top flight.</p>\n<p>Head-to-head moments between Rennes and Lorient at Roazhon Park have been somewhat unpredictable in the past three encounters. Rennes took the spoils in one, but Lorient took the upper hand twice away from home. These results hint that Lorient can be a tricky opponent for Rennes even when playing away, though Rennes look to buck this mini-trend.</p>\n<p>Rennes arrive with four wins in their last six outings, suffering just one defeat and securing one draw. In that run, they have averaged 2 goals per game while conceding 1.33 and maintaining near 15 total shots per contest. Notably, when playing at home over the most recent three matches, Rennes are undefeated, with two wins and a draw, scoring an impressive 2.33 goals per game and allowing just 0.67 goals. Their ball retention also surges at Roazhon Park, where possession topped 60% in this sequence.</p>\n<p>Lorient's momentum in their past six is just as striking, with four victories and two draws, averaging 2.5 goals per match and allowing only 0.5. Their last three home matches have seen faultless performances, but even more telling is Lorient's overall nine-match unbeaten streak across all competitions. Their attacking threat has been consistent with over 17 shots and nearly 6 shots on target per match during this window. Although these results are influenced by home advantage, Lorient's away confidence appears buoyed by this stat.</p>\n<p>Rennes hold 6th position in Ligue 1, winning eight, drawing seven, and losing just three from eighteen games. Their 30 goals scored and a +5 goal difference are significant indicators of a balanced squad that combines effective attack with a capable defense. Of note, the side has won 11 of their last 20 at Roazhon Park.</p>\n<p>Lorient sit in 12th after 18 rounds, with five wins and seven draws, as well as six defeats. They have netted 23 times but conceded on 30 occasions, contributing to a goal difference of -7. This defensive leakiness remains a concern when facing sides with forward power like Rennes.</p>\n<p>For Rennes, form at home is notable. They have achieved 12 undefeated results in the last 15 home matches in all competitions, while keeping a clean sheet in 41% of their last 27 home games. In Ligue 1, they are undefeated in 83% of their most recent 12 home ties, while half of the last eight home games against Lorient ended in their favor. Rennes have also picked up five wins by at least two goals in their last 13 league home matches.</p>\n<p>Lorient have been resilient on their travels. They are undefeated in 80% of their last 15 across all competitions and have drawn half of their last 14 league games. The away side have lost half of their previous 12 league games on the road, however, which tempers their current unbeaten streak.</p>\n<p>Rennes</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Brice Samba</p>\n<p>Defenders: Lilian Brassier, Anthony Rouault, Alidu Seidu</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Przemyslaw Frankowski, Mousa Tamari, Valentin Rongier, Mahdi Camara, Quentin Merlin</p>\n<p>Attackers: Breel Embolo, Estéban Lepaul</p>\n<p>Lorient</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Yvon Mvogo</p>\n<p>Defenders: Bamo Meïté, Nathaniel Adjei, Isaak Touré</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Laurent Abergel, Théo Le Bris, Joel Mvuka, Nathaniel Adjei</p>\n<p>Attackers: Jean-Victor Makengo, Pablo Pagis, Mohamed Bamba</p>\n<p>With both sides featuring defensive improvements and stable attacks, a tightly contested match is expected. Rennes’ recent home numbers and sustained upward trajectory make them slight favorites, and their higher league standing gives them an added edge.</p>\n<p>Statistics point to a low-scoring encounter, most likely under 2.5 goals as projected by the analytics. However, Rennes’ cohesion and home advantage should prove decisive, with a 2-0 result aligning both with probability models (39% chance) and on-pitch narratives. Lorient’s streak without defeat will be tested against a Rennes side looking to continue their own strong home record.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Momentum sits delicately on the line as Moreirense FC host Santa Clara at Parque Desportivo Comendador Joaquim de Almeida Freitas. With both teams looking to shape their season’s narrative, every stat and lineup decision becomes crucial in this intriguing encounter.</p>\n<p>Assessing recent results, Moreirense have managed 2 wins, 2 draws, and 2 losses in their last 6 outings. They have been averaging 1.17 goals per match while conceding 1.5. The last three home fixtures showed a mixed bag: one victory, one draw, and one defeat, with a goal scored per match and two conceded. Possession has been relatively controlled, averaging 56% for the last six and 53% over the last three at home.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara’s trajectory has been less encouraging. They are winless in their last 6 matches, recording three draws and three defeats. Their scoring rate stands at 0.83 per game with 1.33 conceded. Away from home, draws are also a recurring theme, and their possession has hovered around 45.33%. In fact, Santa Clara haven’t secured a win in 12 of their last 15 outings in all competitions.</p>\n<p>The history between these teams in Moreirense’s backyard hints at competitive meetings. Out of their past five encounters in this setting, Moreirense have emerged victorious three times, versus two wins for Santa Clara. No matches have ended in a draw.</p>\n<p>Looking at the last six home league meetings, Moreirense have a 50% win rate, showing they tend to edge out Santa Clara more often than not when hosting.</p>\n<p>Moreirense currently hold 6th place in Liga Portugal, managing 8 wins, 3 draws and 7 defeats from 18 matches. Their tally of 25 goals for and 26 against leaves them with a narrow negative goal difference, illustrating matches that often hang in the balance.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara, positioned at 13th, have struggled more both home and away. They've won just 4 times, drawn 5, and lost on 9 occasions. Their attack has produced 14 goals, an average of just 0.78 per match, with 20 conceded.</p>\n<p>For Moreirense, inconsistency is the story over recent months. In the last 12 outings in all competitions, they have suffered defeat 6 times. At home, however, they've been resilient, remaining undefeated in 80% of their last 15 matches. The attack produces an average of 3.67 shots on goal and the team sustains around 50.92% possession. The historical trend against Santa Clara at home shows Moreirense winning half of the prior 6 meetings.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara are entangled in a more challenging stretch. They are winless in 12 of their last 15 matches across all competitions and haven't emerged victorious in 10 of their previous 12 away games. Draws have characterized 50% of their last 8 games, hinting at difficulty to swing the result their way, while defensive frailties continue to linger.</p>\n<p><strong>Moreirense FC</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Caio Gobbo Secco</p>\n<p>Defenders: Álvaro Martínez Navarro, Michel Augusto Modesto Rafael dos Santos, Jóbson de Brito Gonzaga, Dinis Lourenço Casals Namura Borges Pinto</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Rodrigo Alonso Martín, Alan de Souza Guimarães, Francisco Miguel Ribeiro Tomé Tavares Bondoso, Travassos</p>\n<p>Attackers: Luís Semedo, Cedric Wilfried Teguia Noubi</p>\n<p>Moreirense likely set up in a 4-4-2 formation, leveraging the players who have consistently featured in the starting lineup, while Vasco Sousa is absent with a broken fibula.</p>\n<p><strong>Santa Clara</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Gabriel Batista</p>\n<p>Defenders: Luís Rocha, Sidney Lima, Henrique Silva, Lucas Soares, Paulo Victor</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Adriano Firmino, José Luís Rocha Tavares, Serginho, Gustavo Klismahn</p>\n<p>Attackers: Gabriel Silva</p>\n<p>The probable setup underlines Santa Clara’s flexibility, but with a preference shown to a 5-4-1 formation recently. MT remains out of contention due to injury, ensuring his absence in the lineup.</p>\n<p>Moreirense’s uptick at home and Santa Clara’s sustained troubles, particularly away, provide a potential edge for the hosts. Moreirense have shown they can hold firm in their own stadium, against both middling and struggling sides alike.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara’s search for an away victory continues, with their streak of winless matches underscoring a team battling for cohesive form. The numbers are not in their favor; resolving those attacking woes will be key if they’re to mount a challenge.</p>\n<p>With Moreirense carrying greater consistency and the algorithm giving them a 47% chance of securing a result, a narrow 2-1 win for the home side appears the most probable outcome for this Liga Portugal fixture.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Ajax return to the Johan Cruijff Arena as they look to consolidate their spot near the summit of the Eredivisie, facing a Volendam side desperate to claw away from the lower reaches of the table. The gravity of each point is starting to weigh heavier, and both teams will be eager to leave an imprint on this clash.</p>\n<p>Ajax have shown notable consistency in their overall campaign. Sitting third with nine wins, seven draws, and only three defeats from 19 matches, they boast a positive goal difference of +11 and have found the net almost two times per game on average. Volendam’s journey has been far more turbulent, as they sit in 15th, just four wins to their name and a negative goal difference of -12.</p>\n<p>Delving into recent head-to-head history, Ajax have dominated Volendam in their past five Eredivisie encounters, winning three. At home, Ajax have not lost to Volendam in their last two meetings, with one win and one draw. This underlines a clear psychological and tactical edge for the hosts at their own stadium.</p>\n<p>Ajax’s recent home form further reinforces optimism. Over their previous three league matches at the Johan Cruijff Arena, they are unbeaten, collecting two wins and a draw while conceding only 0.67 goals per game — an indication of defensive solidity on home turf. In their last 11 home league matches, they have avoided defeat in 82% of those games and have managed to keep clean sheets in 42% of their last 12 at home in the league.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Ajax have been productive, averaging 2.67 goals per match over their past six outings. They rack up a healthy 14.83 shots per match and manage 7.17 on target, reflecting their ability to create chances and test opposition keepers regularly. Their ball possession hovers around 58% on average, signalling their intent to control proceedings.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Volendam’s away form has left much to be desired. The team has not recorded a win in 83% of their past 12 away fixtures in all competitions. Recent form offers little relief, as Volendam have lost three out of their last six matches, scoring just 0.67 goals per game in that stretch. Their average shots on goal sits considerably lower than Ajax’s at 4.33, with a time on the ball just below 50%.</p>\n<p>Volendam’s league season has also been a struggle for defensive stability, conceding an average of 1.74 goals per match. While they have managed to avoid heavy defeats in recent trips, their tendency to drop points on the road is a pattern not easily reversed at one of the league’s toughest venues.</p>\n<p>Current injury and suspension news will play a significant role in shaping both starting lineups. Ajax come into this fixture unable to call upon Youri Baas, Owen Wijndal, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Wout Weghorst, and Steven Berghuis due to a mix of injuries and suspensions. Volendam are without Henk Veerman, Yannick Leliendal, and Gibson Yah for similar reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Ajax Probable Lineup (4-3-3)</strong><br/>Goalkeeper: Vitezslav Jaros<br/>Defenders: Lucas Rosa, Anton Gaaei, Ko Itakura, Aaron Bouwman<br/>Midfielders: Youri Regeer, Davy Klaassen, Sean Steur<br/>Attackers: Mika Godts, Kasper Dolberg, Oscar Gloukh</p>\n<p><strong>Volendam Probable Lineup (4-2-3-1)</strong><br/>Goalkeeper: Kayne van Oevelen<br/>Defenders: Mawouna Amevor, Deron Payne, Precious Ugwu, Nick Verschuren<br/>Midfielders: Ozan Kökcü, Aurelio Oehlers, Joel Ideho, Nordin Bukala, Brandley Kuwas<br/>Attacker: Robert Mühren</p>\n<p>The tactical battle is poised to be defined by Ajax’s high-possession, attacking intent against Volendam’s need for discipline and resilience at the back. Ajax’s history of winning by two or more goals in 50% of their last 12 home league matches adds an additional threat for Volendam to consider.</p>\n<p>Given Ajax’s sustained form and Volendam’s travel woes, the probability leans toward a home victory. The algorithmic forecast pins Ajax at a 70% chance to secure all three points, possibly by a 2-1 margin. With the likelihood of Ajax maintaining their high attacking output, their supporters will expect another confident display at the Arena.</p>\n<p>As the Eredivisie regular season ticks on, more is at stake with each fixture. Ajax aim to continue their strong home record, while Volendam face an uphill challenge to take something away from Amsterdam.</p>",
