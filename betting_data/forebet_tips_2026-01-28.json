    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Ajax step into this one with two different faces: a team that has tightened up at home in recent outings, and a side still searching for authority in this Champions League campaign. Olympiacos arrive more balanced, hardened by strong away form, yet burdened by a difficult continental record.</p>\n<p>Ajax’s Champions League story so far is a rough read. Seven matches have yielded 2 wins, 0 draws and 5 losses, with 7 goals scored and 19 conceded, an average of 2.71 against per game that has left them 32nd in the league-stage standings. That contrasts with their broader form, which has trended upward across all competitions.</p>\n<p>Over the last six matches in all competitions, Ajax have 3 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss, averaging 1.83 goals scored and 2.17 conceded. They have not been defeated in 5 of those 6, and they are unbeaten in their last 3. At home, the picture is brighter still: across their last three home games in all competitions they recorded 2 wins and 1 draw, scoring 2.0 per match and allowing just 0.67.</p>\n<p>Production has returned too. Ajax’s last six outings show 17.5 total shots and 7.5 on target per match, with 60.67% possession. At home, those averages climb to 21.33 total shots and 9 on target, albeit with 53% possession. That suggests more purposeful, vertical play at the Johan Cruijff Arena, with a clearer route to chance creation.</p>\n<p>Yet the Champions League-specific trends remain a warning. Ajax have lost 50% of their last 24 home matches in this competition, and 67% of their last 12 Champions League fixtures have been defeats by 2 or more goals. They have also been winless in 86% of their last 7 Champions League home games. The task is to let the recent all-competitions stability bleed into a continental setting that has been unforgiving.</p>\n<p>Olympiacos, under Mendilibar, carry sharper form into the matchup. Over their last six matches in all competitions they have 4 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss, scoring 2.0 and conceding only 0.5 per game. They average 16.33 shots and 5.33 on target with 55% possession, a profile of a side that creates enough while remaining compact without the ball.</p>\n<p>On the road, the Greek side’s trends are impressive: undefeated in 88% of their last eight away matches in all competitions, with 60% wins across their last 20 away fixtures and 42% clean sheets in the last 12 away games. Flip to Champions League-only numbers and the tone softens. Olympiacos sit 24th in the standings with 2 wins, 2 draws and 3 losses from seven, and they are winless in 9 of their last 11 in this competition, having lost 50% of their last 26 Champions League matches.</p>\n<p>Tactically, Ajax’s 4-3-3 should look to stretch the Olympiacos back line through wide combinations and early service into Kasper Dolberg. With 7.5 shots on target per game in their last six, Ajax can test a defense that has been sturdy in domestic and recent away contests. The key duel lies in midfield control: Youri Regeer and Davy Klaassen must outplay a double pivot designed to screen and spring transitions.</p>\n<p>Olympiacos will likely default to 4-2-3-1, leaning on Chiquinho and Dani García to deny Ajax vertical lanes and release the trio behind the striker. Mehdi Taremi’s hold-up play and Daniel Podence’s movement between the lines offer balance, while Gelson Martins and Christos Mouzakitis provide the outlets to turn defense into chances.</p>\n<p>Recent history tilts in subtle ways. Ajax’s last 12 matches in all competitions include being undefeated in 10, and 40% clean sheets across their last 15 home matches in all competitions hint at improvement. Olympiacos bring steadier away form but must translate that to a Champions League setting where their win rate has lagged.</p>\n<p>Ajax probable XI</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Vitezslav Jaros</p>\n<p>Defenders: Lucas Rosa, Anton Gaaei, Aaron Bouwman, Youri Baas</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Youri Regeer, Davy Klaassen, Sean Steur</p>\n<p>Attackers: Mika Godts, Kasper Dolberg, Rayane Bounida</p>\n<p>Olympiacos FC probable XI</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Konstantinos Tzolakis</p>\n<p>Defenders: Costinha, Panagiotis Retsos, Giulian Biancone, Francisco Ortega</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Chiquinho, Dani García, Gelson Martins, Christos Mouzakitis, Daniel Podence</p>\n<p>Attackers: Mehdi Taremi</p>\n<p>With Ajax’s shot volume at home and their recent unbeaten run, the algorithm edges them as winners at 41% probability, and a 2-0 scoreline fits the pattern if they manage the midfield and limit counterattacks. Prediction: Ajax win, 2-0.</p>",
