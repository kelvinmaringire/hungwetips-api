    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two heavyweight squads meet with a place in the final on the line, and the numbers suggest a contest where control in midfield and ruthlessness in transition could decide everything.</p>\n<p>Arsenal and Chelsea approach this semi-final with contrasting paths but converging momentum. One side leans on controlled volume and structure, the other on surging form and sharp transitions. The balance between Arsenal’s chance creation and Chelsea’s cutting edge should define a tie that looks finely poised on paper.</p>\n<p>Recent history tilts toward Arsenal. Across the last three meetings in all competitions, Arsenal have 2 wins, 1 draw and 0 losses. Add that two of the last four head to head ended level, and that Arsenal have won by 2 or more goals in 5 of their last 13 home meetings against Chelsea, and you get a picture of a matchup where the hosts have often found solutions without always running away with it.</p>\n<p>Arsenal’s last six in all competitions show 4 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss, with 2.5 goals scored and 1.33 conceded per match. They have averaged 17.17 total shots and 6.33 on target with 54.33% possession. At home across the last three, the ledger reads 1 win, 1 draw and 1 loss, 1.67 scored and 1.67 conceded, with 16.33 shots and a healthy 57% possession. That blend suggests sustained territory and chance volume, though not invulnerability.</p>\n<p>Widen the lens and Arsenal’s consistency becomes clearer. In all competitions, they have won 77% of their last 30 matches, scoring 2.23 and conceding just 0.77 per game, and they have kept 13 clean sheets in their last 30 at home. In the EFL Cup specifically, they have won 56% of their last 36 matches, scoring 1.86 and conceding 1.17, while winning 60% of their last 15 at home in the competition.</p>\n<p>Chelsea arrive in strong form. Over the last six in all competitions they have 5 wins, 0 draws and 1 loss, averaging 2.33 scored and 1.33 conceded, with 12 shots and 5.17 on target, and 59.33% possession. They are on a surge with 5 wins in their last 5, and undefeated in those 5. Away from home in all competitions, they have won 50% of their last 20 and are undefeated in 13 of their last 16.</p>\n<p>In the EFL Cup, Chelsea’s sample is robust too: 17 wins in their last 30 matches with 1.93 scored and 0.9 conceded on average, and they have been undefeated in 80% of those. Their away profile shows a 35% rate of wins by 2 or more across their last 31 away games in all competitions, underlining a capacity to break games open.</p>\n<p>Tactically, Arsenal’s recent shift between 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 trends toward 4-3-3 for bigger ties, anchoring with Declan Rice and Martín Zubimendi while freeing Martin Ødegaard between the lines. Expect high shot volume and pressure through wide combinations. Chelsea’s 4-2-3-1 has solidified around Moisés Caicedo and Enzo Fernández, with João Pedro leading the line and creativity from Cole Palmer, Estêvão or Pedro Neto. Their chance quality has improved even with lower overall shot counts.</p>\n<p>Squad availability could matter most for the visitors. Chelsea are without Axel Disasi, Tosin Adarabioyo, Levi Colwill, Mykhaylo Mudryk, Caleb Wiley, Roméo Lavia and Dário Essugo, trimming options in defense and on the wings. Arsenal list only Max Dowman out, leaving Mikel Arteta with depth and flexibility across the back line and front three.</p>\n<p>Arsenal probable XI (4-3-3):</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: David Raya<br/>Defenders: Jurriën Timber, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhães, Piero Hincapié<br/>Midfielders: Declan Rice, Martín Zubimendi, Martin Ødegaard<br/>Attackers: Bukayo Saka, Viktor Gyökeres, Leandro Trossard</p>\n<p>Chelsea probable XI (4-2-3-1):</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Robert Sánchez<br/>Defenders: Reece James, Trevoh Chalobah, Benoît Badiashile, Marc Cucurella<br/>Midfielders: Moisés Caicedo, Enzo Fernández, Estêvão, Cole Palmer, Pedro Neto<br/>Attackers: João Pedro</p>\n<p>With Arsenal’s 93% undefeated rate across their last 40 in all competitions and Chelsea undefeated in 13 of their last 16 away, margins look thin. The Forebet model points to a draw at 35% probability with a projected 2-2. Given Arsenal’s shot volume and Chelsea’s current streak, both to score feels likely, and the call is a stalemate that stays alive late. Prediction: Draw, 2-2.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">At Ewood Park, two struggling sides meet as Blackburn Rovers prepare for a crucial Championship clash with Sheffield Wednesday. Both teams are fighting to find their form, making this encounter one to closely monitor as the relegation battle intensifies.</p>\n<p>Blackburn Rovers and Sheffield Wednesday meet on February 3rd at Ewood Park in a matchup defined by pressure and the urgent need for points. The league table paints a challenging picture; Blackburn sit 22nd with 7 wins in 29 matches, while Sheffield Wednesday occupy the bottom spot, having registered just a single league victory so far.</p>\n<p>The recent history between these two sides tilts slightly toward Sheffield Wednesday. Across their last six encounters in all competitions, Wednesday have triumphed three times, with two matches finishing level and Blackburn collecting just a single win. Notably, in five of those meetings, Blackburn lost by 2 or more goals on two occasions, underlining some difficult memories.</p>\n<p>Blackburn's recent form is a cause for concern. Looking at their last six outings in all competitions, they have failed to win once, drawing three and losing the other three, and have averaged only 0.67 goals scored and 1.67 conceded. At home, they have fared a little better in terms of defensive solidity but remain winless, with two draws and one defeat in their last three at Ewood Park, scoring exactly one goal per match while conceding an average of 1.33.</p>\n<p>The overarching trends make challenging reading for Blackburn. They are now winless in 20 of their last 25 matches in all competitions and their winless run stretches through all of their last nine fixtures. At the same time, draws have been prominent, contributing to 8 draws in their last 15 overall, and they have lost 10 out of their last 20 home matches in league action.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Blackburn struggle to consistently test opposition goalkeepers, with just 2.33 shots on target per match across their last six, although they're seeing a healthy share of possession averaging over 53% in that span.</p>\n<p>Sheffield Wednesday’s plight is even more acute. Their last six fixtures have all ended in defeat, without scoring a single goal and conceding an average of 1.83. Their attacking output is the lowest in the division, managing just 18 goals in 29 matches, under 0.7 per outing, and they've been shut out entirely in their recent away games too.</p>\n<p>The away trends are grim: Wednesday are winless in 38 of their last 40 matches across all competitions. Away from Hillsborough, they've failed to pick up a victory in 17 of their last 20, and are currently enduring a 24-match winless streak in all contests. Consistent losses — particularly by two or more goals, 13 in their last 34 — highlight their defensive vulnerabilities on the road.</p>\n<p>In terms of predicted lineups, squad news plays a role. Blackburn Rovers will be without Hayden Carter, sidelined after knee surgery. Based on recent selections and availability, the expected starters in a 4-2-3-1 formation are:</p>\n<p><strong>Blackburn Rovers</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Balázs Tóth</p>\n<p>Defenders: Lewis Miller, Sean McLoughlin, Eiran Cashin, Connor O'Riordan</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Sondre Tronstad, Todd Cantwell, Ryoya Morishita, Adam Forshaw, Mathias Jørgensen</p>\n<p>Attackers: Yuki Ohashi</p>\n<p>Sheffield Wednesday will be missing Guilherme Siqueira, who is recovering from an Achilles tendon injury. Their likely starting lineup, with recent trends and a common 4-2-3-1 structure, is:</p>\n<p><strong>Sheffield Wednesday</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Murphy Cooper</p>\n<p>Defenders: Liam Palmer, Gabriel Otegbayo, Reece Johnson, Cole McGhee</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Jaden Heskey, Svante Ingelsson, Barry Bannan, Jamal Lowe, Charlie McNeill</p>\n<p>Attackers: Bailey Cadamarteri</p>\n<p>Given Sheffield Wednesday's current seven-game losing streak and 24 straight matches without a victory, along with an attack that has not found the net in their last six, Blackburn Rovers stand a decent chance to turn their fortunes around. The prediction leans toward a Blackburn victory (45% probability), with a likely 2-0 scoreline suggested by both the home side’s slightly superior attacking stats and Wednesday’s chronic struggles at both ends of the pitch.</p>\n<p>With both teams desperate to reverse negative streaks, this fixture could provide a much-needed spark — particularly for Blackburn Rovers if they can make their home advantage count.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">As Serie A enters another crucial round, all eyes turn to Stadio Renato Dall’Ara where Bologna host high-flying Milan. The visitors have been enjoying a lengthy unbeaten run in the league, while Bologna are searching for composure after a string of frustrating results. Both sides come into this match looking to assert themselves — one to maintain title ambitions, the other to re-establish footing in the upper half of the table.</p>\n<p>Milan make the trip to Bologna sitting second in the standings with 13 wins, 8 draws, and just a single defeat from 22 games. They have scored 35 goals and conceded 17, boasting a +18 goal difference. In contrast, Bologna are eighth, recording 8 victories, 6 draws, and 8 losses, with a more modest goal difference of +5 and a tally of 32 goals scored versus 27 conceded in the same number of fixtures.</p>\n<p>The recent history between the sides paints a balanced picture. Bologna’s last three home games against Milan have produced a win, a draw, and a defeat. However, Milan have had the edge in broader recent encounters, with Bologna losing two of the last three meetings, and in their previous five head-to-head home clashes, they have lost by two or more goals twice against Milan’s incisive attack.</p>\n<p>Form coming into this match suggests Milan hold the initiative. They haven’t suffered a loss in any of their past 6 league outings, taking three wins and three draws. With an average of 1.33 goals scored and just 0.67 conceded per contest in this period, Milan appear difficult to break down. Their away prowess is evident as well — they remain undefeated in 16 of their last 20 away matches across all competitions and have secured 8 clean sheets, underlining an effective defensive setup on their travels.</p>\n<p>Bologna’s form gives cause for concern. They have managed only one victory in their last 6 matches, with two draws and three losses. At home, they are winless in their last three, drawing once and losing twice, with just three goals scored and six conceded. An 88% winless streak across their last 8 home games accentuates struggles, though their historical 80% home undefeated record over the last 40 matches in all competitions suggests they can be tenacious when required.</p>\n<p>The trends are stark. Bologna have gone winless in 9 of their last 11 league fixtures, and 86% of their past 7 Serie A home matches. Defensive gaps are apparent too, with only four clean sheets in their last ten home league games. Milan, meanwhile, have been unbeaten in their last 12 league fixtures and have drawn 50% of their last 8, suggesting resilience but also the possibility of points dropped.</p>\n<p>In terms of on-pitch statistics, Milan average 14.67 shots per game (4.5 on target) in their last 6 matches, controlling the ball just over half the time. Bologna, on the other hand, fire more with 16.33 shots but are less clinical, hitting the target only 4.17 times on average. They do edge Milan in possession, averaging 56.33%, but have not turned that into consistent wins.</p>\n<p>Looking to probable lineups, both squads are at near full strength with no significant suspensions or injuries. Bologna are expected to stick with their preferred 4-2-3-1 formation, while Milan will retain their customary 3-5-2 shape.</p>\n<p><strong>Bologna (4-2-3-1 predicted):</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Federico Ravaglia</p>\n<p>Defenders: Emil Holm, Torbjørn Heggem, Martin Vitík, Juan Miranda</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Remo Freuler, Tommaso Pobega, Riccardo Orsolini, Benja Domínguez, Jens Odgaard</p>\n<p>Attacker: Santiago Castro</p>\n<p><strong>Milan (3-5-2 predicted):</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Mike Maignan</p>\n<p>Defenders: Koni De Winter, Fikayo Tomori, Matteo Gabbia</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Alexis Saelemaekers, Adrien Rabiot, Luka Modrić, Youssouf Fofana, Davide Bartesaghi</p>\n<p>Attackers: Rafael Leão, Christopher Nkunku</p>\n<p>The algorithm prediction slightly favors Milan to come away with all three points, with a 48% probability of victory and an expectation of a narrow 2-1 scoreline. Milan’s consistency and defensive solidity give them the upper hand against a Bologna side that is struggling for rhythm, but Stadio Renato Dall’Ara is never an easy place for visitors. The clash promises to be a true test of Milan’s aspirations and Bologna’s capacity for a response against elite opposition.</p>",
