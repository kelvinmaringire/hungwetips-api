    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Arsenal return to Elland Road aiming to reinforce their Premier League aspirations against a Leeds United side seeking to defy the odds. With both teams showing different forms across recent weeks, this encounter could hold notable implications at both ends of the table.</p>\n<p>Arsenal have displayed strong overall consistency, capturing three wins and two draws in their past six matches. Their average goals per match during this spell stands at 2, while they only concede 1.17 on average. This demonstrates a solid backbone and attacking flair.</p>\n<p>Leeds United, meanwhile, have managed two victories and three draws in their own last six matches. They concede just slightly more than Arsenal, but notably their goal scoring stands at 1.5 per match over this stretch. At home, Leeds are tougher to break down—winning two and drawing one of their last three games and conceding less than a goal per outing in that sequence.</p>\n<p>When it comes to direct encounters, Arsenal’s dominance is clear. In the last three visits to Elland Road, they have come away victorious twice and drawn once. Leeds have failed to defeat Arsenal at home in those encounters, which will no doubt be on the minds of both coaching staffs.</p>\n<p>Arsenal currently top the Premier League table after 23 rounds, securing 15 victories, five draws, and losing just three times. Their formidable 42 goals for and mere 17 conceded have propelled them to an impressive +25 goal difference.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Leeds sit 16th, with only six wins, eight draws, and nine losses. They’ve netted 31 times but conceded 38, resulting in a negative goal difference that underlines their defensive vulnerabilities throughout the campaign.</p>\n<p>Digging deeper into the trends: Leeds United are undefeated in 83% of their last 12 matches in all competitions. At home, they've gone without defeat in 13 of their last 15 outings, and managed clean sheets in 48% of their last 40 at Elland Road.</p>\n<p>However, against Arsenal, Leeds have lost all of their last three encounters, and in 56% of their last nine, they've suffered losses by two or more goals. In Premier League play, they’ve gone winless in 83% of their last six matches.</p>\n<p>Arsenal, meanwhile, have won 65% of their last 20 in all competitions, including 13 wins from their previous 20 Premier League matches. They remain undefeated in 13 of their last 15 competitive games. Away from home, clean sheets have been kept in 45% of recent matches and they’ve secured two or more goal wins in 40% of their last 15 away contests.</p>\n<p>Leeds United</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Lucas Perri</p>\n<p>Defenders: Pascal Struijk, Joe Rodon, Jaka Bijol</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Ethan Ampadu, Gabriel Gudmundsson, James Justin, Anton Stach, Ilia Gruev</p>\n<p>Attackers: Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Brenden Aaronson</p>\n<p>Arsenal</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: David Raya</p>\n<p>Defenders: William Saliba, Piero Hincapié, Gabriel Magalhães, Jurriën Timber</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Martin Ødegaard, Martín Zubimendi, Declan Rice</p>\n<p>Attackers: Bukayo Saka, Leandro Trossard, Viktor Gyökeres</p>\n<p>The matchup puts Arsenal’s efficiency and momentum against Leeds’ desire to frustrate the league leaders on home soil. Based on all performance indicators and recent head to head results at Elland Road, Arsenal hold the advantage, supported by their defensive stability and recent away winning trends.</p>\n<p>The most probable outcome, factoring in attacking statistics and patterns, points towards a match featuring over 2.5 goals. The likely victorious side is Arsenal, with a projection placing their probability of winning at approximately 55%. A 2-1 scoreline is suggested as most likely given current performances and trends.</p>\n<p>This contest presents Arsenal an opportunity to underline their aspirations while Leeds aim to stand firm against another top side, with both sides possessing plenty of statistical storylines heading into the matchup.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">As the Championship season winds into a critical stage, Leicester City and Charlton Athletic prepare to meet at King Power Stadium. With both sides looking to reverse recent struggles and claim valuable points, this matchup carries weight for ambitions at both ends of the table.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams faced off was back in August, when Leicester City edged Charlton Athletic 1-0 on the road. Issahaku Fatawu scored in the 48th minute, settling a tightly contested match. It was a day when Charlton had the majority of chances, firing 20 shots to Leicester’s 6 and managing 7 shots on target. Despite holding only 45% of possession, Charlton threatened consistently with 62 dangerous attacks, but Jakub Stolarczyk’s goalkeeping and Leicester’s efficient approach made the difference.</p>\n<p>Now, roles are reversed. Leicester take home advantage, aiming to repeat their earlier success, while Charlton search for a way to finally turn attacking output into results. The two clubs’ seasons have developed along similar lines since that encounter—each looking for consistency, frequently hindered by defensive lapses or missed opportunities in front of goal.</p>\n<p>Leicester City currently sit 14th in the Championship after 29 games, having won 10, drawn 8, and lost 11. Their goal tally stands at 40, an average of 1.38 per game, offset by 43 conceded. Recent form has been mixed: just 2 wins in the last 6 matches, with 1 draw and 3 losses. They have scored an average of 1.33 goals and conceded 1.5 during this spell.</p>\n<p>The Foxes have shown slightly better form at home. Over their last 3 matches at King Power Stadium, they have claimed 2 wins, scoring 1.67 goals per game and conceding 1.33. Ball possession in these matches averaged a healthy 56.33%, indicating they like to dictate play when possible. Still, inconsistency lingers; across the last 8 home matches, Leicester have won exactly 50% in the Championship.</p>\n<p>Charlton Athletic enter this fixture 19th in the standings, precariously close to the relegation zone, with 8 wins, 8 draws, and 12 defeats from 28 matches. They have netted 27 goals, or just under 1 per game, and let in 38. In their last 6 matches, Charlton have struggled, collecting a single win, with 2 draws and 3 losses. They have averaged only 1 goal scored and 2.33 goals conceded per match in this stretch.</p>\n<p>Travel has not been kind to Charlton. They are winless in 11 of their last 12 away matches (92%), and have lost 50% of their last 20 on the road in all competitions. There’s a worrying defensive trend too: they have lost by 2 or more goals in 43% of their last 7 away games. This leaky record places significant pressure on their rearguard against a Leicester side that, even if misfiring, still creates regular opportunities at home.</p>\n<p>Looking at squad news, Leicester will have to do without the influential Harry Winks, who is suspended. His absence could see Oliver Skipp and Jordan James hold midfield together. Charlton must cope without Luke Chambers, sidelined with a back injury, but should otherwise line up close to full strength.</p>\n<p>Based on starting patterns over the last three matches (and accounting for absentees), probable lineups are as follows:</p>\n<p>Leicester City</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jakub Stolarczyk</p>\n<p>Defenders: Ricardo Pereira, Ben Nelson, Caleb Okoli, Luke Thomas</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Jordan James, Bobby De Cordova-Reid, Oliver Skipp, Issahaku Fatawu, Stephy Mavididi</p>\n<p>Attackers: Jordan Ayew</p>\n<p>Charlton Athletic</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Thomas Kaminski</p>\n<p>Defenders: Kayne Ramsay, Macaulay Gillesphey, Lloyd Jones</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Karoy Anderson, Joe Rankin-Costello, James Bree, Harry Clarke</p>\n<p>Attackers: Miles Leaburn, Charlie Kelman, Harvey Knibbs</p>\n<p>Leicester have struggled to string positive results together, going winless in their last 3. On the other hand, Charlton’s away trend is yet more troubling—they haven’t found victory in 11 of their last 12 games away from The Valley.</p>\n<p>Given both sides’ recent form and their performances in the reverse fixture, a tight contest is predicted. Statistical models favor a draw at 40% probability, with a potential repeat of attacking intent from both sides but perhaps a lack of finishing touches to tilt the balance. A 2-2 scoreline would not surprise based on these trajectories.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two teams with contrasting fortunes lock horns at Estadio Nuevo Carlos Tartiere as Real Oviedo seek to end a frustrating run against a Girona squad quietly climbing the La Liga table. Recent encounters suggest a one-sided history, making this clash all about resolve versus momentum.</p>\n<p>When it comes to direct matchups, Girona have enjoyed a steady hand over Real Oviedo. Across their last six meetings, Real Oviedo have not managed a single win, drawing three and losing three.</p>\n<p>This inability to find a breakthrough has haunted Oviedo, who continue searching for answers against an opponent they have consistently struggled with.</p>\n<p>Real Oviedo's current form does little to inspire confidence. Over their last six La Liga matches, they have failed to secure a victory, finishing with three draws and three losses while averaging just 0.67 goals scored per match and conceding two per game.</p>\n<p>The story is much the same at home, though Oviedo have managed three consecutive draws in their last trio of matches at the Carlos Tartiere. Notably, these games were low scoring: Oviedo scored just 0.33 and conceded 0.33 per match on average, showing greater defensive resistance but continued attacking struggles.</p>\n<p>Girona, meanwhile, arrive in better shape. They have taken four wins from their last six matches (with one draw and one defeat) and scored an average of 1.33 goals per outing. Defensively solid, they've conceded just one per match.</p>\n<p>This form isn’t just a brief uptick: Girona are undefeated in 83% of their last six contests and have won half of their last eight games in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Oviedo’s situation in the table echoes their recent history. With only two wins from 21 league matches, they find themselves languishing at the bottom—20th—having drawn seven and lost twelve.</p>\n<p>With just eleven goals scored (an average of 0.52 per game) and 34 conceded, their negative goal difference of minus 23 highlights their problems at both ends of the pitch.</p>\n<p>Girona’s journey has been steadier and more positive. They sit comfortably in 9th with 21 goals scored and 35 conceded from the same number of matches. They have crafted six wins and seven draws so far, keeping themselves in touch with the top half despite a challenging defensive record.</p>\n<p>Oviedo’s malaise is stark in their trends. They haven’t won a single match in their last 15 outings in all competitions, a run that now stands at 15 consecutive games without victory.</p>\n<p>Of particular concern for the hosts, they have lost by two or more goals in 9 of their last 23, and 4 of their last 10 home fixtures. However, they have stayed undefeated in 5 of their last 6 at home, hinting at stubbornness on familiar ground.</p>\n<p>For Girona, their ability to bounce back away from home is mixed. They have claimed wins in 50% of their last six away matches but remain winless in 16 of their last 20 on the road. Still, five wins in their last ten league contests reflects timely improvements, and their 80% undefeated record over the last ten league games signals consistency.</p>\n<p>Given the patterns in recent selections and accounting for current injuries, the likely lineups shape up as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Real Oviedo:</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Aarón Escandell</p>\n<p>Defenders: Lucas Ahijado, David Costas, David Carmo, Rahim Alhassane</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Alberto Reina, Santiago Colombatto, Ilyas Chaira, Kwasi Sibo, Haissem Hassan</p>\n<p>Attackers: Federico Viñas</p>\n<p><strong>Girona:</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Paulo Gazzaniga</p>\n<p>Defenders: Hugo Rincón, Vitor Reis, Daley Blind, Álex Moreno</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Bryan Gil, Thomas Lemar, Iván Martín, Arnau Martínez, Viktor Tsygankov</p>\n<p>Attackers: Vladyslav Vanat</p>\n<p>Expect Girona to capitalize on Real Oviedo’s prolonged struggles. The visiting side’s recent league consistency, coupled with Oviedo’s lengthy winless stretch (15 in all competitions), sets up a challenge that history suggests Oviedo will struggle to meet.</p>\n<p>The algorithm favors Girona, projecting a 46% probability for an away win, most likely by a 2-0 margin. Real Oviedo’s defensive improvements at home may make Girona work for their advantage, but on current form, the visitors look poised to continue their successful run in this head-to-head fixture.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">As the Bundesliga regular season marches on, Hoffenheim welcome Union Berlin to the PreZero Arena. With both teams entering the confrontation in differing spells of form, insights from their recent encounters provide a deeper understanding of what to expect on January 31.</p>\n<p>Hoffenheim have been a team full of confidence. Their recent home run is particularly impressive, collecting three consecutive victories while averaging 3.33 goals scored and just 0.67 conceded over those outings. Christian Ilzer’s men have gone undefeated in 16 of their last 20 matches in all competitions, a streak that speaks to both resilience and tactical growth.</p>\n<p>The data underlines Hoffenheim’s dominance in their fortress. In their last 14 home matches across competitions, they’ve chalked up seven wins. Their attacking output has been efficient, with an average of 5.08 shots on target per match at the PreZero Arena. Possession averages above 50% further confirm their intent to control proceedings.</p>\n<p>Union Berlin arrive in Sinsheim sitting mid-table. Their position of 9th in the league is a reflection of a campaign marked by inconsistency. The visitors have won just two of their last six matches, drawing three and losing once. In that span, their attack has produced 1.33 goals per match while conceding the same figure, painting the picture of a team yet to find a rhythm away from home.</p>\n<p>Though Union Berlin have a reputation for defensive solidarity, they have found it difficult to pick up away results. Over their last 25 away outings in all competitions, they have lost by a margin of two or more goals in 36% of fixtures. The current streak sees them winless in their last four matches, indicating a need to sharpen their approach on the road.</p>\n<p>Historically, recent head-to-head data tilts slightly in Union Berlin’s favor, with five wins from the most recent 10 meetings, compared to Hoffenheim’s three, alongside two draws. The margin, however, has often been narrow, amplifying the competitive nature of this rivalry. In the last five home matches against Union, Hoffenheim have lost by two or more goals twice, so the danger is ever-present.</p>\n<p>Looking at starting elevens, injuries play a role for both clubs. Hoffenheim are missing regulars like Grischa Prömel, Alexander Prass, and Cole Campbell, which could influence their midfield configuration. Nevertheless, the backbone remains steady and likely to stick to a familiar formation. The probable lineup for Hoffenheim, using their most frequent choices and available players:</p>\n<p><strong>Hoffenheim</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Oliver Baumann</p>\n<p>Defenders: Robin Hranac, Bernardo, Albian Hajdari, Vladimír Coufal</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Leon Avdullahu, Grischa Prömel, Fisnik Asllani, Andrej Kramaric</p>\n<p>Attackers: Tim Lemperle, Max Moerstedt</p>\n<p>Union Berlin also have absent players including Andrej Ilic and Tom Rothe. They are, however, expected to stick to their functional 3-4-2-1, which has brought stability despite recent struggles. The likely eleven is:</p>\n<p><strong>Union Berlin</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Frederik Rönnow</p>\n<p>Defenders: Diogo Leite, Danilho Doekhi, Leopold Querfeld</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Josip Juranovic, Rani Khedira, András Schäfer, Derrick Köhn</p>\n<p>Attackers: Ilyas Ansah, Woo-yeong Jeong, Oliver Burke</p>\n<p>Taking into account Hoffenheim’s firm home record and Union Berlin’s solid if unspectacular form, the data points toward a tightly contested fixture. The hosts hold a significant undefeated streak and showcase strong attacking stats at home, whereas Union Berlin’s habit of drawing games and resilience in the league cannot be underestimated.</p>\n<p>The prediction for this clash leans towards a balanced outcome. With both teams carrying notable strengths and some weaknesses, a draw, with a 37% probability, appears to be the most likely result, possibly echoing a 2-2 scoreline.</p>\n<p>This match is set to be a test of Hoffenheim’s recent momentum against Union Berlin's efforts to break their winless run. All indications are that this could turn into another hard-fought chapter of their Bundesliga encounters.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Both AC Pisa and Sassuolo find themselves at a pivotal juncture of the Serie A season, with recent form leaving much to be desired. The Arena Garibaldi - Stadio Romeo Anconetani will play host as each side looks to address concerning streaks and climb up the league standings.</p>\n<p>The previous encounter between these teams paints an intriguing backdrop. When Sassuolo hosted Pisa late last year, the contest ended 2-2 with drama unfolding until the final whistle. Sassuolo enjoyed significant control, registering 21 shots to Pisa's 10 and commanding 63% of possession. Their 71 dangerous attacks overwhelmed Pisa's 29, yet defensive lapses saw them concede twice—goals through M'Bala Nzola and Henrik Meister. Pisa, meanwhile, made the most of limited opportunities and demonstrated resilience, particularly with Henrik Meister's effort late in the match, before Kristian Thorstvedt salvaged a point deep into stoppage time for Sassuolo. Despite Sassuolo’s statistical dominance, a share of the points reflected Pisa’s efficiency and clinical moments when under pressure.</p>\n<p>Examining AC Pisa’s current trajectory, recent results reveal a team mired in difficulty. Across their last six league outings, Pisa have failed to register a win, instead recording three draws and suffering three defeats. They average just 1 goal per game while conceding a worrying 2.5, compounded by only 38.17% average possession. Pisa's home performances reflect these struggles—no wins in their last three at the Arena Garibaldi, a lone draw, and 0.33 goals scored per home fixture versus conceding 2.</p>\n<p>Trends do little to inspire confidence for Alberto Gilardino’s men. Pisa haven't notched a victory in 14 of their last 15 matches overall, while in their past 11, they remain winless—losing six of the previous 12. Defensive issues are evident, losing by a margin of 2 or more goals in 40% of their last 10 fixtures, though clean sheets have arrived in 40% of their last 10 at home. Yet, scoring efficiency remains an issue with a meagre average of 2.5 shots on target in those home games.</p>\n<p>Sassuolo, managed by Fabio Grosso, are far from soaring themselves. The past six matches have yielded one victory, two draws, and three defeats, with the team scoring at a rate of just 0.5 per contest, despite more promising shot and possession averages (44.33%) than their opponents. On the road, Sassuolo have little to brag about—winless in five of their last six away matches and losing half of their last 12 trips. Nevertheless, their league standing, with seven victories and a negative goal difference of just -4, speaks to a more balanced campaign compared to Pisa, who sit 19th with a goal difference of -19.</p>\n<p>In terms of league-wide numbers, Sassuolo have lost 13 of their last 26 in all competitions but have not allowed margins to spiral too drastically. Their attacking output, boasting 24 league goals, marginally edges Pisa’s tally of 18. Defensively, Sassuolo are tighter as well, conceding an average of 1.27 per match compared to Pisa’s 1.68.</p>\n<p>Planning for this matchup, both teams must navigate injury issues. For Pisa, the absence of goalkeeper Adrian Semper, defensive leader Raúl Albiol, Daniel Denoon, and Mateus Lusuardi further depletes resources already stretched thin by form. Sassuolo are likely to be without Edoardo Pieragnolo and Fali Candé at the back. As a result, both coaches are expected to stick to familiar formations—Pisa set up in a 3-4-2-1 and Sassuolo in the favored 4-3-3.</p>\n<p><strong>AC Pisa probable lineup:</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Simone Scuffet</p>\n<p>Defenders: Simone Canestrelli, Francesco Coppola, Rosen Bozhinov</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Samuele Angori, Marius Marin, Idrissa Touré, Michel Aebischer</p>\n<p>Attackers: Henrik Meister, Matteo Tramoni, Stefano Moreo</p>\n<p><strong>Sassuolo probable lineup:</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Arijanet Murić</p>\n<p>Defenders: Josh Doig, Sebastian Walukiewicz, Jay Idzes, Tarik Muharemović</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Nemanja Matic, Luca Lipani, Ismaël Koné</p>\n<p>Attackers: Armand Laurienté, Andrea Pinamonti, Alieu Fadera</p>\n<p>Looking at the trends, a stalemate appears plausible. Both sides are under pressure to tighten up defensively and points may be prioritized over open play. Forebet algorithm points to a draw as the most probable outcome (37% probability), predicting under 2.5 goals and a goalless scoreline. Considering Pisa’s inability to break their winless run in 14 of their last 15, and Sassuolo’s struggles away from home, the stage looks set for a fiercely contested—if low scoring—affair where defensive diligence could prove paramount.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">A showdown between Paris FC and Olympique Marseille is set for January 31, 2026, at the Stade Jean Bouin. Both sides arrive with differing fortunes in the Ligue 1 Regular Season, and recent data suggests a compelling contest may unfold.</p>\n<p>Paris FC enters the fixture sitting 14th in the league standings with 5 wins, 5 draws, and 9 losses from 19 matches. Their negative goal difference of -8 and 24 goals scored highlight some attacking issues, as they average just 1.26 goals per match while conceding 1.68.</p>\n<p>Performance at home has been uneven. Over their last 3 home matches, Paris FC are winless, drawing twice and losing once, scoring just 0.33 goals per game while conceding 1.33. Their average possession at home, just under 40%, indicates opponents dictate the tempo.</p>\n<p>Wider trends show Paris FC winless in 7 of their last 8 home matches (88%). Despite this, they've managed undefeated runs in 24 of their last 30 home Ligue 1 games, hinting at resilience even when struggling for wins.</p>\n<p>Looking at their most recent six matches in all competitions, they've won 3, drawn once, and lost 2. Their defensive solidity at home is occasionally displayed, with 5 clean sheets in their last 12 league home matches (42%). However, inconsistency and a lack of goals persist in their recent outings.</p>\n<p>The head-to-head record is limited, having faced Olympique Marseille only once recently, suffering a defeat without managing to score or draw. This puts them at a psychological disadvantage facing a strong opponent.</p>\n<p>Olympique Marseille come into this game with momentum and sit third in the league table. Their record boasts 12 wins, 2 draws and just 5 losses from 19 matches. With 44 goals scored (2.32 per game) and only 20 conceded (1.05 per game), they have a formidable attack and a robust defense.</p>\n<p>Their away form supports this confidence. Marseille are undefeated in 7 of their last 8 away matches (88%), and have won 9 of their last 18 on the road. Clean sheets have sometimes eluded them away, but their attacking prowess compensates, with 3.17 goals scored on average in their last 6 league games. Over these 6 matches, they have won 3, drawn 1, lost 2, and enjoyed significantly more possession than Paris FC (59.5% average).</p>\n<p>Recent home streaks for Marseille further underline their strength, with 2 wins and a draw in their last 3. They have shown the ability to win by sizeable margins, notching up victories by 2 or more goals in 4 of their last 10 matches in all competitions.</p>\n<p>Paris FC's most likely formation, based on recent selections, remains a 5-4-1, focusing on defensive solidity. They are expected to start:</p>\n<p><strong>Paris FC</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Kevin Trapp</p>\n<p>Defenders: Moustapha Mbow, Otávio, Timothée Kolodziejczak, Nhoa Sangui, Thibault De Smet</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Alimami Gory, Adama Camara, Maxime Lopez, Jonathan Ikoné</p>\n<p>Attacker: Willem Geubbels</p>\n<p>Olympique Marseille persist with their attacking 3-4-2-1 shape. Expect the following lineup:</p>\n<p><strong>Olympique Marseille</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Gerónimo Rulli</p>\n<p>Defenders: Leonardo Balerdi, Facundo Medina, Benjamin Pavard</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Timothy Weah, Ulisses Garcia, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, Arthur Vermeeren</p>\n<p>Attackers: Mason Greenwood, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Igor Paixão</p>\n<p>Statistically, Olympique Marseille possesses the superior firepower and defensive organization to control the encounter. The most recent performances support their role as favorites, bolstered by dominance in possession and shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Prediction models currently give Marseille a 66% probability to secure victory, with a likely scoreline around 3-1 in their favor. Paris FC may look to frustrate and counter but will require exceptional defensive discipline to defy the formbook.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">Two teams with contrasting fortunes face off at Estádio de São Miguel as Santa Clara looks to snap an extended winless streak, while GD Estoril arrives eager to cement their spot in the top half of Liga Portugal. Both sides are familiar foes, setting the stage for a fascinating matchup on the Azores.</p>\n<p>The most recent meeting between these teams took place on September 6, 2025, with Santa Clara coming away with a narrow 1-0 victory at Estoril’s ground. Gabriel Silva delivered the decisive moment from the penalty spot in the 53rd minute. Possession statistics weighed in favor of the hosts, with Estoril holding 60% of the ball and outnumbering Santa Clara in dangerous attacks (48 to 36), but both teams recorded four shots on goal from nearly identical shot totals.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara proved clinical and resilient defensively, absorbing pressure from Estoril’s midfield while capitalizing on their key opportunity. Recent meetings reflect parity rather than dominance between the sides, as Santa Clara have won twice in their last four against Estoril but also lost two.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara has struggled for momentum, suffering a seven-match winless streak in all competitions and managing only three draws in their last six fixtures. Offensively, they have found the net just five times across that stretch and have failed to score in any of their last three home games, where their average shots on goal drops to two per game.</p>\n<p>Estoril, in contrast, shows stronger recent form. They have won four of their last six, scoring an average of 2.5 goals per match, fueled by clinical finishing and a creative midfield. While their away record is not flawless, with two defeats in their last six away fixtures, Estoril maintains a healthy attacking rhythm, averaging over five shots on target per match on the road.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara's campaign in Liga Portugal has them in 14th place with four wins and five draws from 19 games, but 10 defeats underline their inconsistency. A mere 14 goals scored points to lingering issues in attack, countered somewhat by a defense that concedes just above a goal per game.</p>\n<p>Estoril stands 8th in the league, propelled by an impressive 37-goal haul in 19 matches. While their defense remains a concern with 31 conceded, a positive goal difference and more than 1.9 goals per game highlight a confident, forward-thinking side. Estoril’s 7 wins and 5 draws speak to a team capable of controlling games but still vulnerable at the back.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara’s home has not been a fortress of late. They are winless in 21 of their last 26 matches in all competitions and have only managed a clean sheet in 42% of their previous 12 home league matches. However, half of their last 40 home fixtures have ended in victory, showing they are capable of grinding out results when it matters.</p>\n<p>Estoril rides a wave of offensive form, winning half of their last 14 in all competitions and posting multi-goal victories in 43% of their last seven. They have also proven tough to beat at home, going undefeated in 9 of their last 11 Liga Portugal home games, but will look to extend that resilience to their travels.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Gabriel Batista</p>\n<p>Defenders: Luís Rocha, Frederico Venâncio, Sidney Lima, Henrique Silva</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Serginho, Lucas Soares, Paulo Victor, Adriano Firmino</p>\n<p>Attackers: Gabriel Silva, Vinícius Lopes</p>\n<p>Estoril</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Joel Robles</p>\n<p>Defenders: Ricard Sánchez, Pedro Amaral, Felix Bacher, Kévin Boma</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Jandro Orellana, Jordan Holsgrove, João Carvalho, Rafik Guitane</p>\n<p>Attackers: Alejandro Marqués, Yanis Begraoui</p>\n<p>On current form and attacking productivity, Estoril holds the edge as they seek to capitalize on Santa Clara’s winless streak. While the Azoreans will look to replicate the defensive resilience from their last encounter, the visitors’ firepower appears likely to tip the balance. The forecast suggests GD Estoril takes all three points, with the prediction algorithm giving them a 43% probability of victory.</p>",

    "preview_html": "<p class=\"intro\">With just one point separating AZ Alkmaar and Nijmegen in the Eredivisie standings, the encounter at AFAS Stadion promises to showcase some of the league’s most consistent performers. Both teams have staked a strong claim in the upper echelons, and while each side comes armed with its unique strengths, their recent histories set the stage for a balanced contest.</p>\n<p>AZ Alkmaar head into this home fixture positioned fifth on the table after 20 matches, collecting 9 wins, 5 draws, and 6 losses. They've netted 35 goals while conceding 32, boasting a positive, albeit modest, goal difference of +3. The visitors, Nijmegen, sit just above in fourth place with 10 wins, 5 draws, and only 4 losses from 19 matches, backed by a much healthier goal difference of +16 and 49 goals to their name.</p>\n<p>The recent narrative between these two sides at the AFAS Stadion is one of complete parity. Across the last 6 meetings here, AZ Alkmaar have won 2, drawn 2, and lost 2 against Nijmegen, highlighting just how closely matched the clubs have been on Alkmaar’s turf.</p>\n<p>In terms of current form, AZ Alkmaar have found relative stability in front of their own supporters. Across their last 3 home matches, they've remained unbeaten, grabbing 2 wins and a draw. During this spell, they've averaged 2.67 goals per game, only conceding 0.33 on average. Their attack has been sharp, with 8.67 shots on target and decent control in possession at 49.33%.</p>\n<p>Broaden the view to their overall recent outings and it's been a story of mixed results: 3 wins, 1 draw and 2 defeats in their last 6. Over their last 15 home matches in all competitions, AZ Alkmaar have avoided defeat on 14 occasions, a testament to their reliable defensive structure and home resilience.</p>\n<p>Nijmegen arrive riding the crest of a quietly impressive streak. The club haven't tasted defeat in any of their last 6 Eredivisie matches, picking up 4 wins and 2 draws, while maintaining an average of 2.5 goals scored per match. Their away record adds steel to their credentials, with Nijmegen undefeated in 80% of their last 15 outings away from home. Even more telling, they have avoided defeat in 16 of their previous 20 league matches, consistently picking up results regardless of venue.</p>\n<p>Recent form for Nijmegen underscores a blend of attacking verve and efficiency, averaging 5.5 shots on target and 57.33% possession over their last 6 matches. Their last 3 outings, all wins, reflect a team in rhythm and difficult to break down.</p>\n<p>When comparing broader trends, AZ Alkmaar have won 60% of their last 40 matches in all competitions, with particularly strong performances on goal attempts and possession metrics at home. Their recent home defensive record includes 6 clean sheets from the last 15, and they've won by 2 or more goals in 6 of those encounters. For Nijmegen, their own win record stands at 60% over the last 15 fixtures, while they’re undefeated in 93% of those matches, underscoring their consistency throughout the season.</p>\n<p>Squad depth will be tested for both teams. AZ Alkmaar are missing key players, including Meerdink and Clasie, while Nijmegen must make do without Bram Nuytinck in defense and Bryan Linssen up front among others. Analyzing recent starting elevens and considering absences, the likely lineups are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>AZ Alkmaar (4-2-3-1):</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Jeroen Zoet</p>\n<p>Defenders: Wouter Goes, Alexandre Penetra, Elijah Dijkstra, Mees de Wit</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Weslley Patati, Peer Koopmeiners, Isak Jensen, Kees Smit, Kasper Boogaard</p>\n<p>Attackers: Troy Parrott</p>\n<p><strong>Nijmegen (3-4-1-2):</strong></p>\n<p>Goalkeeper: Gonzalo Crettaz</p>\n<p>Defenders: Philippe Sandler, Ahmetcan Kaplan, Eli Dasa</p>\n<p>Midfielders: Başar Önal, Darko Nejašmić, Kodai Sano, Sami Ouaissa</p>\n<p>Attacker (Central): Tjaronn Chery</p>\n<p>Attackers: Koki Ogawa, Noé Lebreton</p>\n<p>With AZ Alkmaar drawing 50% of their last 6 home encounters versus Nijmegen and the visitors undefeated in all of their last 10 matches across all competitions, it’s tough to separate the teams given their respective stability and tenacity.</p>\n<p>Taking into account the defensive solidity of AZ Alkmaar at home and Nijmegen’s ability to grind out results, the balance of probabilities points to a draw, suggested at 45% likelihood by the analytical models. A 1-1 scoreline fits the weight of recent trends, as both sides appear finely matched in both form and firepower.</p>",
